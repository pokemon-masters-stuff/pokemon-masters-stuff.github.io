    "ch0108_40_nobori/0101_0701_02_10": "If I can be of service in any way, please let me\nknow! I will come to your aid faster than an\nexpress train!",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_01_10": "This outfit feels different from my Battle Subway\nuniform. I feel competent and put together!",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_02_10": "I feel like I could complete any task to perfection\nwearing this!",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7101_0701_03_10": "In the meantime... May I offer you something\nto drink?",

    "ch0108_40_nobori/7104_0701_02_10": "Now he is enjoying being a host here on Pasio.",
    "ch0108_40_nobori/7104_0701_03_10": "However, he’s still new to this style of hospitality.\nWould you mind keeping an eye on him?",

    "ch0108_40_nobori/3001_0701_01_10": "Are you heading out for the day? I wish I had\nyour energy this early in the morning. I’d better\ntrain harder, or you’ll pass me right up.",
