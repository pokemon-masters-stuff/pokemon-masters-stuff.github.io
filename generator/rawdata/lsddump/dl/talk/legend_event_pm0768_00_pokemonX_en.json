    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_2100_10": "But it was challenging myself and giving up on\nother things that shaped my future!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_2200_10": "Those changes weren’t always bad—they made\nme who I am today!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_2300_10": "That’s why it’s impossible to predict the future!\nYou said so yourself, remember?",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_2600_10": "We don’t know what will happen...yet you want\nme to have hope?",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_3100_10": "I think that those endless possibilities are what\nchange the future. It’s not just the power of\none person.",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5004_1001_3800_10": "But it was all in vain! As long as there are fools\nin this world, all that potential we raised will also\nbe stolen!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_0400_10": "Lysandre! You don’t have to rush to a conclusion!\nWe can still find a way to save everyone!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_0500_10": "Nothing can change me now!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_0700_10": "No matter the means, I will change this world\nback to its former beauty!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_0900_10": "It’s for a weapon that will erase foolish humans\nfrom the world and restore it to its original\nbeautiful state.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1000_10": "Xerneas sidetracked my plans a bit...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1100_10": "And this weapon isn’t as strong as what I\nprepared back in Kalos, but it’s enough to get rid\nof Xerneas and this entire island!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1200_10": "What?!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1300_10": "No matter who wins this battle, we can’t change\nthe tragic future that awaits us!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1600_10": "I’m sorry, but this is adieu.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5005_1001_1700_10": "... ... ...\nWhy?! Why won’t it activate?",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5006_1001_0100_10": "Professor! Just like you said, we found a\nsuspicious device!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5006_1001_0200_10": "We all got together to cut off its energy! It won’t\nbe able to activate now!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5006_1001_0300_10": "How’s that, Team Flare! This is payback for\nthat power outage in Lumiose City!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_0301_0100_10": "What was that call about?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_0401_0200_10": "Clemont and the others were able to stop the\nweapon from activating!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_0302_0300_10": "Was that Clemont’s voice I heard?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_0402_0400_10": "Yup! I had him gather some sync pairs that know\na lot about machines! They worked together and\ndefused the weapon!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_0500_10": "I secretly had Clemont and the others working on\nthings so that we could stop your plan, Lysandre.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_0600_10": "Actually, I knew you were here on Pasio, though I\nhad no proof of it.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_0700_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ], you know...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_0800_10": "No matter what Lysandre did on Pasio, for\nany reason...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_0900_10": "I knew that your shining and boundless potential\nwould allow us to get Xerneas to understand us.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1000_10": "Not only that—I had a feeling you’d be able to\nhelp us change Lysandre’s mind and change the\nfuture into something new.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1100_10": "But now...I suppose I should take responsibility,\ngiven the situation.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1200_10": "Lysandre, we were able to change the terrible\nfuture you thought was going to happen. ",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1300_10": "But it wasn’t just the power of one person. We all\nworked together to make it happen.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1400_10": "Your convictions would reduce these infinite\nhopes and possibilities.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1500_10": "Don’t you think so?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1600_10": "... ... ...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1700_10": "Heh.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1800_10": "It seems I wasn’t able to completely take away\nthe flame of conviction in your heart.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_1900_10": "You were able to work with Xerneas—that makes\nyou a chosen one.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2000_10": "You and those children... I suppose I should admit\nyou might have the potential to change the future.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2100_10": "However...my convictions haven’t changed.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2200_10": "That’s unfortunate.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2300_10": "I cannot simply erase the flame of conviction in\nmy heart.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2400_10": "So remember this...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2500_10": "If you ever use Xerneas’s power for the wrong\nreasons, or if your convictions turn down the\nwrong path...",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2600_10": "Yes, I know. I’ll remember that.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2700_10": "I definitely won’t let that happen to any of us.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2800_10": "I look forward to that...old friend.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_2900_10": "I won’t give up! I will continue to make this world\na more beautiful existence!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_3100_10": "Even if he doesn’t understand it now, I’m sure he’ll\nchange his ways eventually.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5007_1001_3200_10": "Because his dream is to make the world a better\nplace, just like ours is.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0100_10": "So you saw a Pokémon you’ve never seen before\nthat had large antlers?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0200_10": "Yeah! It looked super strong! I bet it was that\nLegendary Pokémon people have been\ntalking about!",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0300_10": "You sure? Really?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0400_10": "The Life Pokémon, Xerneas... It’s said it’s able to\ngive eternal life.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0500_10": "It’s a Legendary Pokémon that is the opposite of\nYveltal, which takes life.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5301_1001_0600_10": "I must act quickly, before it falls into the hands of\nfoolish humans!",

    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5302_1001_0400_10": "Have you heard the rumors that the Legendary\nPokémon Xerneas showed up on Pasio?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5302_1001_0500_10": "A Legendary Pokémon appeared out of the blue...\nI’m sure there’s a reason why it came here.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5302_1001_0600_10": "I may just be mistaken, though.",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5302_1001_0700_10": "That said, would you be willing to help us look\ninto whether the rumors are true?",
    "legend_event_pm0768_00_pokemonX/5302_1001_0800_10": "I’ll send the location of where we’re meeting up to\nyour Poryphone. I hope to see you there!"
