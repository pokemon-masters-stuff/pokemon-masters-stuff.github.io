    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0301_0300_20": "But what could it be?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_0400_10": "Miltank! Go ahead and Rollout!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0302_0500_20": "Is it...a Pokémon?!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0402_0600_10": "Miltank! Go ahead and Rollout!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1101_0700_20": "Incredibly, the pink object turned out to be\nWhitney’s Miltank.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_0800_10": "Sorry if we scared ya! Miltank and I were just\nplayin’ a little.",

    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_1000_10": "You don’t have to be so hard on us!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_1100_10": "It’s not like we’re playin’ all the time!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0302_1200_10": "Taking a rest sometimes is important.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0402_1300_10": "Yeah, you get it!",

    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_1500_10": "When I’m here, it sure does make me\nfeel relaxed.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_1600_10": "Oceans and ranches... That’s what we’re all\nabout, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0301_1700_10": "Oceans and ranches?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_1800_10": "Things look a little different where I come from,\nbut there’s an ocean right by my hometown of\nGoldenrod City, too.",

    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_2100_10": "And Miltank grew up on a ranch. \nThat’s where I first met her.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_2200_10": "Thinkin’ about it takes me back to that first time\nI ever went to visit that ranch.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_2300_10": "All of a sudden, Miltank used Rollout and\ncame right at me!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_2400_10": "It was like she was tryin’ to test me!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0301_2500_10": "Test you?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_2600_10": "Well, I can’t be sure, but I think Miltank was\nlookin’ for someone to come and take her away\nfrom that ranch.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0302_2700_10": "Did she want to battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0402_2800_10": "Well, I can’t be sure, but I think Miltank was\nlookin’ for someone to come and take her away\nfrom that ranch.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_2900_10": "But not just anyone, so she used that move to\nsee if I was the right Trainer for her.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3000_10": "Although I didn’t know that at the time!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3100_10": "Of course, I dodged her Rollout, but I wondered\nwhat in the world was goin’ on!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3200_10": "But then she just kept comin’ at me, bumpin’ into\nme, sendin’ me flyin’, and I found that\ndetermination so adorable.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3300_10": "Before I knew it, Miltank and I were playin’\ntogether all the time.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0301_3400_10": "And the ranch let you take her?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_3500_10": "That’s right!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0302_3600_10": "So you stole her?",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0402_3700_10": "Hey now! Don’t go spreadin’ rumors about me\nlike that!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3800_10": "An old guy at the ranch told me I could\nhave Miltank.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_3900_10": "I mean, he actually was happy to have me take\nher off his hands!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4000_10": "He said it seemed like Miltank had always\nwanted to leave the ranch and see the world.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4100_10": "That’s why I try to make sure Miltank does more\nthan just battle. She has to enjoy herself while\nshe’s out seein’ the world, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4200_10": "I gotta make her new life better than her life\nback on the ranch.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4300_10": "I don’t want her to regret leavin’ her home.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0301_4400_10": "I’m sure she doesn’t.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0401_4500_10": "I hope you’re right.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0302_4600_10": "I’m sure she’s happy.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_0402_4700_10": "I hope you’re right.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4800_10": "To be honest, I don’t really know what’s best\nfor Miltank.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_4900_10": "But I do know that she knows I’m tryin’ to do my\nbest for her.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_5000_10": "So I hope she stays with me for a long,\nlong time.",
    "charaepi_ch0026_00_akane/2301_1201_5100_10": "That would be the best!\nAt least, that’s how I feel about it."
