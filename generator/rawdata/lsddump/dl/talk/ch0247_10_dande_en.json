    "ch0247_10_dande/0101_0701_02_10": "Let’s have a champion time together!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7101_0701_01_10": "Did you know that Eternatus came to the Galar\nregion 20,000 years ago, attached to a meteor?",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7101_0701_02_10": "It came all the way from outer space to meet us...",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7101_0701_03_10": "When you think about it, it sounds like a fantasy!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7102_0701_01_10": "I’m completely different from Eternatus... We grew\nup in different places and in different ways.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7102_0701_02_10": "I think most people would worry about how to\nget along with someone so different from them. ",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7102_0701_03_10": "But when we battle, I know that we’re connected,\ndeep in our hearts!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7102_0701_04_10": "I think Eternatus feels the same way, too! It’s doing\nits best to get along with humans!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7103_0701_01_10": "Raihan has been challenging me to a lot of\nbattles recently.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7103_0701_02_10": "When we battle, it’s super intense! We can feel\nthe power of Eternatus and all our other Pokémon\nup close!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7103_0701_03_10": "I’d like to have a battle like that with you, too! I’ll\nbe sure to challenge you soon!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7104_0701_01_10": "This sygna suit matches Eternatus.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7104_0701_02_10": "What do you think of this pattern on the sides?\nWicked, isn’t it?",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7104_0701_03_10": "When you see an opening, you’ve got to attack!\nThat’s what it represents!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7105_0701_01_10": "I often have Eternatus and Charizard spar with\neach other.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7105_0701_02_10": "They clash with all their might to make each\nother stronger!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/7105_0701_03_10": "You and I could have the same sort of rivalry, too!\nThat’s a surefire way for us to get stronger!",

    "ch0247_10_dande/1701_0702_01_10": "Go ahead and use it right away!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0701_01_10": "I tend to get lost quite often.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0701_02_10": "Sometimes, Eternatus will walk in front of me and\ntry to lead the way...",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0701_03_10": "but I don’t think Eternatus is concerned about\nwhere I’m headed. So in the end, we still\nget lost...",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0702_01_10": "I may choose the wrong path by mistake, but I\ndon’t want to make any mistakes when choosing\nmy future. You feel the same way, don’t you?",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0702_02_10": "Although...I’ve never actually regretted any of the\npaths I’ve chosen.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2501_0702_03_10": "Because everything I’ve chosen until now has\nworked out in the end!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2511_0701_01_10": "It can be emotionally demanding to be responsible\nfor such an incredible power.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2511_0701_02_10": "In the end, I can only rely on my own strength to\nwield that power!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2511_0702_01_10": "I still don’t know if I’m a Trainer worthy of\nEternatus’s respect yet.",
    "ch0247_10_dande/2511_0702_02_10": "But what I can do now is gain more strength as\na Trainer and trust Eternatus!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/3001_0701_01_10": "Once the sun rises, the future is upon us!\nLet’s give it our all today!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/3003_0701_01_10": "It’s lunchtime. We’d best replenish our energy with\na good meal! What do you want to eat? It’ll be\nmy treat!",
    "ch0247_10_dande/3005_0701_01_10": "Whoa! Time certainly does fly! But we can have a\nchampion time no matter how late it gets!"
