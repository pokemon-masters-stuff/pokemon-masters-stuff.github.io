    "ch0036_00_mamane/0101_0701_02_10": "I’ve got my new invention up and running...\nMaybe I’ll head out for a little bit, too.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0601_0701_01_10": "I’m not really the greatest around\nother people. When people stare at me, I...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0601_0701_02_10": "... ... ...\n... ... ...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0601_0701_03_10": "You may not have noticed, but I just\nfainted, like, three times...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0601_0702_01_10": "I’m trying really hard to get used to\nother people looking at me.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0601_0702_02_10": "But trying your best doesn’t automatically\nguarantee good results... Just like\nexperimenting with a hypothesis.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0701_01_10": "I can use this gadget to control\na bunch of my inventions.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0701_02_10": "For example...this one.\nMy Trainer Pinger.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0701_03_10": "Using this machine will call Trainers\nover to your current location...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0701_04_10": "but using it requires a massive\namount of electricity.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0702_01_10": "Did you know this little gadget can\nactually control a bunch of the machines\nI’ve invented?",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0602_0702_02_10": "I may have been the one who engineered it,\nbut it’s the power of science that’s\nREALLY amazing!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0603_0701_01_10": "You know, I was pretty surprised when I\nfound out that Togedemaru is thought\nto have no Evolution.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0603_0701_02_10": "Just think—she was born a little\nroly-poly, and she’ll always be one,\nno matter how much she grows.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0603_0701_03_10": "It’s kinda cool... If people were like that,\nwe could get away with paying the kid’s\nprice for the bus and stuff forever.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0603_0702_01_10": "Some people tell me I look like\nmy Togedemaru.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0603_0702_02_10": "We’re really good buddies, so I guess\nwe could be rubbing off on each other.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0701_01_10": "My Charjabug helped me a lot with\nmy experiments back on Ula’ula Island.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0701_02_10": "They let me use some of the electricity\nthey have stored in their bodies.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0701_03_10": "Also, their bodies are made up of right\nangles, so if my creativity’s ever blocked,\nI can stack them up like bricks for fun...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0701_04_10": "Just kidding. I’ve gotta be nice to my\nCharjabug, or their friend Vikavolt\nwill get mad and come flying...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0702_01_10": "Vikavolt is Charjabug’s Evolution.\nIt gathers up energy in its jaws, then\nfires it off in massive electric jolts!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0604_0702_02_10": "It’s like a cannon! It can even break\nthrough the thickest shelters.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0701_01_10": "Since coming here to Pasio, I’ve made\nsome good headway in my various\nexperiments.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0701_02_10": "I mean, there’s so much interesting data!\nThe people and Pokémon gathered here\nare way beyond my knowledge!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0701_03_10": "Same goes for you, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nIf this were my simulation, I’d have\nbeaten you a hundred times over.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0701_04_10": "Although that simulation hasn’t been\nvery reliable lately. Even when I\nwas back in Alola...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0702_01_10": "According to my simulation, I should\nbe Champion by now.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0702_02_10": "Bathing in the spotlight, a role model\nfor all kinds of Trainers...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/0605_0702_03_10": "Oh boy... I think I just fainted for a\nsecond at the thought of that...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/1701_0701_01_10": "I didn’t invent this or anything,\nbut it should be pretty useful.\nHere, take it.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/1701_0702_01_10": "Hopefully it’ll be super effective\nfor you in battle!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/1701_0702_02_10": "I have my own inventions to help me\nin battles, so I don’t need it.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0701_01_10": "Wh-what are you looking at?\nHold on... Have you been bitten by the\ninventor bug?",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0701_02_10": "If that’s the case, maybe we could\ntry making something basic together?",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0701_03_10": "... ... ...\n... ... ...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0701_04_10": "(Oh no... What if you weren’t curious about\ninventing and you were actually curious\nabout ME...)",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0702_01_10": "I did about 256 simulations while\npondering what it is you’d like\nto invent.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0702_02_10": "My conclusion: a machine that can\nuse the plans and blueprints in your brain\nto create everything automatically.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0702_03_10": "With a machine like that, you’d only\nhave to THINK about an invention\nin order to bring it to life!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2501_0702_04_10": "What?! That sounds like something I’d\nwant for myself?! Well...when you put it\nlike that, I guess you’re not wrong...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0701_01_10": "What? You’re interested in how\nmachines are constructed?\nWhy didn’t you say so sooner?",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0701_02_10": "Well, first you have to think about\nwhat you want your machine to do.\nThat part is key!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0701_03_10": "Like, if you’re scared of talking to\npeople, maybe a machine that makes it\neasier to do that?",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0701_04_10": "Actually, that might just be something\nI want personally...",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0702_01_10": "After you figure out what kind of\nmachine you’re making, the next step\nis to draw up a blueprint.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0702_02_10": "Careful, though. If you muck up the\npower supply or drive systems, you’ll\nget zapped like BZZZZT!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0702_03_10": "But you’ll be fine as long as you keep an\neye on things as you go. I wouldn’t\nworry about it too much.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/2511_0702_04_10": "Failure’s a big part of inventing things.\nThat’s a fact! You’ve just gotta keep\nadjusting things until it’s just right.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning. I-I’m still so sleepy.\nI stayed up way too late running experiments.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3002_0701_01_10": "*yawn*\nMy batteries are fully charged, but my motor’s\nnot up and running yet. I might need to reboot.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3003_0701_01_10": "Oh, hey! The sun is too bright for me.\nI prefer staying in my lab.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3004_0701_01_10": "Maybe I’ll exercise this afternoon.\nGotta think about my health at least a little bit.",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3005_0701_01_10": "I-I’m kinda nocturnal, so it’s about time\nfor me to start my experiments for the night!",
    "ch0036_00_mamane/3006_0701_01_10": "I conserve energy at night by using the electricity\nmy Electric-type Pokémon have stored up."
