    "ch0094_00_genji/2511_0702_02_10": "Just because you make it to me, don’t think that\nI won’t go down without a fight!",
    "ch0094_00_genji/2511_0702_03_10": "And because it’s you, this ol’ Drake will give\nyou everything he’s got!",
    "ch0094_00_genji/3001_0701_01_10": "Looks like you had a restful sleep. A good day\noften starts after a good night, doesn’t it.",
