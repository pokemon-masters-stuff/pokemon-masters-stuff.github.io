    "ch0128_00_mitsuru/0604_0701_03_10": "I’m the kind of Trainer who likes to plan my\nstrategy before a battle.",
    "ch0128_00_mitsuru/0604_0701_04_10": "But when it’s time for the real thing, I can get\ncaught up in the battle and forget my strategy...\nI don’t think that’s a bad thing, though.",
