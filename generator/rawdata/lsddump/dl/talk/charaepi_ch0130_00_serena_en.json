    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2301_1201_0300_10": "Feel that refreshing breeze? It reminds me of the\nwind on the day we first set out from home.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2301_0402_1700_10": "Haha, you’ve got that right! But this wouldn’t be\nmuch of an adventure without a few headwinds.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2301_1201_2900_10": "Take Tierno—he’s got some serious dance moves.\nThen there’s Trevor, who never misses a single\nquestion on his tests.",
    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2301_1201_3000_10": "Shauna’s always kind and radiates cuteness, and\nCalem taught me a lot about being a Trainer.",

    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2311_1201_0100_10": "Lumiose City over in Kalos has such a stylish\nlook to it! Especially the Prism Tower...",
    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2311_1201_0200_10": "Something tells me that what really interests you\nabout the Prism Tower is its Gym...",
    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2311_1201_0300_10": "You saw right through me! I do love fashion, \nbut I love a good Pokémon battle, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2311_1201_0400_10": "In that case, why don’t you and I have a battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0130_00_serena/2311_0101_0100_10": "Absolutely! I was hoping we’d get the chance!",
