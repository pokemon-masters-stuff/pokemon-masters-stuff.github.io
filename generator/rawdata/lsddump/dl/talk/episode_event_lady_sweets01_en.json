    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_0300_10": "O-oh, not at all. These people were saying they\nneeded some a-advice...",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_0400_10": "Advice? What kind of advice?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_0500_10": "We’d like to get our mentors a gift to thank them\nfor all they’ve done for us.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_0600_10": "They really like sweets, so we wanted to find\nan extra-special treat for them...",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_0700_10": "But we’re not confident that what we’d choose\nwould be good enough!",

    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1100_10": "It’s true that we might be able to help you.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1200_10": "But that means we’d be letting you in on our\nmost exclusive dessert spots!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1300_10": "To be honest, it’ll take more than just a request to\nget us to spill our secrets like that.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1400_10": "Aww, really?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1500_10": "P-please, won’t you reconsider?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1600_10": "Well...how about this, then?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1700_10": "Would you help us train by being our opponents\nin battle?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1800_10": "I wouldn’t mind sharing my go-to spots if you’re \nable to make the battle interesting for us.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_1900_10": "I could get behind that.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2000_10": "Let me join you, too!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2100_10": "I’m not nearly as strong as the two of you, but I’m\nno slouch when it comes to sweets!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2200_10": "Thank you so much!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2300_10": "Very well. Shall we begin?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2400_10": "What we look for in our opponents is\nsuperb strength...",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4001_1001_2500_10": "So make your best effort not to bore me with a\nyawn-inducing battle. Clear?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0100_10": "Thank you for all you’ve done as our mentors!\nWe have some presents for you!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0200_10": "Oh my!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_1400_10": "It looks so elegant and tasty! Thank you for the\nlovely gift!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0300_10": "I don’t think I’ve ever seen this before. Where’d\nyou find it?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0400_10": "We went through intense training with some fancy\nladies so they’d tell us all about their super-secret\ndessert spots!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0500_10": "Yeah! They may look proper and well-mannered,\nbut that training was super vicious!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0600_10": "*chuckle* Is that so? Well, as long as it was\ntraining, I’m sure you’re stronger for it.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0700_10": "Hold on a second.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0800_10": "When you asked them for advice, you didn’t tell\nthem who you were getting these for, did you?!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_0900_10": "Oh, not to worry! We didn’t give them any names.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_1000_10": "Thank goodness!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_1100_10": "Haha! We athletes need to be careful about our\npublic image. It’s pretty hard to hide my sweet\ntooth, though!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_1200_10": "I’m not really hiding mine... Though I guess\npeople’d be surprised to hear I like sweets.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4002_1001_1300_10": "Let’s just keep that a secret, then. Come on!\nLet’s dig in!",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0100_10": "After all that, I wonder who those sweets\nwere for.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0200_10": "Didn’t they mention something about muscles?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0300_10": "Mhm. I suppose those mentors weren’t just\nmentoring them in battles.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0400_10": "The only one I know who fits that profile\nis Bruno...",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0500_10": "I think Bea’s also got a sweet tooth.",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0600_10": "M-maybe G-Grant, too?",
    "episode_event_lady_sweets01/4003_1001_0700_10": "*chuckle* You’d never know that those three\nactually love sweets, despite all appearances!"
