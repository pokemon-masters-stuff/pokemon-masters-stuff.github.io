    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_0401_3700_10": "Snivy’s got a great eye! She can tell\nif you’re totally in character or not.",

    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_0402_3900_10": "Snivy’s got a great eye! She can tell\nif you’re totally in character or not.",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_4000_10": "See, your aura kinda changes when you\ntake on a role and you really\nembody that character.",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_4100_10": "And little Snivy here is ultra sensitive\nto that sort of thing!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_4200_10": "I think it’s, like...one of those things that\nonly a Pokémon can truly sense, you know?",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_4300_10": "Snivy’s always on the lookout—even during\nPokémon battles! She watches her opponents\nreally carefully.",

    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_5000_10": "I’ll always be me in the end, though!\nThat’s never gonna change!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_5100_10": "I’ll study a bunch of Trainers and learn\nwhat I can from imitating them, but I’m\nnot just gonna copy whatever they do.",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2301_1201_5200_10": "I’m gonna take all that new knowledge\nand experience and use it to flavor\nmy OWN battle style! And I’m gonna win!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_1201_0100_10": "Mwahaha! ’Tis I, Brycen-Man!\nI have waited an eternity for this\nday to come, Snivy-Girl!",

    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_1201_0300_10": "Hm? You wish to do some intensive training\nwith your Snivy? Well then, I shall oblige!\nPrepare to be defeated!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_1201_0400_10": "Wh-what’s going on?!\nIt’s like you’ve totally become the\ncharacter you play in the movies!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0101_0100_10": "I knew this day would come!\nI procured this Zoroark for that very purpose!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0101_0200_10": "Now, bring it!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0501_0100_10": "How? How did you manage to brush aside ME,\nBrycen-Man, and my mighty Zoroark so easily?\nI underestimated you, Snivy-Girl...",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0501_0200_10": "Brycen, you don’t have to keep up the act\nanymore! You came here to battle for Snivy\nand my sake, didn’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0501_0300_10": "I...I have no idea what you’re talking about!\nF-farewell, Snivy-Girl!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2311_0501_0400_10": "Whoa! Snivy, are you about to evolve?!\nI just felt this sudden rush of power!",

    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2312_1201_0100_10": "Rosa, I’m confident your Servine still has\nplenty of room to grow. So come on!\nLet’s battle it out and see what he can do!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2312_1201_0200_10": "Yes! Of course I’ll battle you!\nYou and Onix are as strong as rocks, \nthough, so we’ll give it our best shot!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2312_1201_0300_10": "I’ve been wanting to fight in an all-out\none-on-one battle with you for a long time!\nCome on—let’s do this!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2312_1201_0400_10": "O-K! Let’s do this, Servine!",
    "charaepi_ch0101_00_mei/2312_0101_0100_10": "Just see if you can get past the impenetrable\nwall of my rock-solid willpower and my\nOnix’s rock-hard armor!",
