    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_1700_10": "All right, here’s a special treat.\nI’ll tell you how I met my Pinsir!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_1800_10": "Clean those ears out and listen up!",

    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2200_10": "Well, from there, it was a conversation between\nmy fists and his horns.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2300_10": "But here’s the thing. See these horns?\nThey’re hard as anything! \nWe weren’t getting anywhere!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2400_10": "So we entered a war of attrition.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2500_10": "See, I knew that Pinsir can’t move \nas quickly on cold nights.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2600_10": "And just as I planned, \nPinsir finally forfeited to me!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_2700_10": "And ever since then, we’ve been best buddies!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0301_2800_10": "That was wild!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0401_2900_10": "Nah, just a day in the life of a guy who can let \nhimself stay curious.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0302_3000_10": "I’m surprised you got out of that OK.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0402_3100_10": "Well, you can’t move forward if you’re afraid,\nya know?",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_3200_10": "I want to test what I know, and I want to\nknow what I don’t already know.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_3300_10": "But in order to do so, I have to be\nphysically strong.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_3400_10": "So what do you think?\nYou feel like you got stronger already, don’t ya?",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0301_3500_10": "Uh, I’m not sure about that.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0401_3600_10": "Come on! You’re wasting your life away with\nthat kind of attitude!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0302_3700_10": "Yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0402_3800_10": "Good answer! Ha ha!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_0402_3900_10": "Earnest people get strong!\nThey can absorb a lot more that way!",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_4000_10": "Whether you can use my story to make yourself\nstronger is all up to you.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_4100_10": "But don’t just think about it, because that’s not\nenough. You have to experience it yourself, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_4200_10": "If there’s something you want to do, try it.\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re nervous about it\nor if you’re crummy at it.",
    "charaepi_ch0046_00_datsura/2301_1201_4300_10": "Being able to do that is the most important\nquality you can have!"
