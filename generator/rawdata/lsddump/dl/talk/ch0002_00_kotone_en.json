    "ch0002_00_kotone/0101_0701_02_10": "Exploring together with friends is\nway more fun than going it alone!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0701_01_10": "Hehe. My Chikorita is pretty cute, right?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0701_02_10": "The leaf on her head is especially cute!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0701_03_10": "If you get close to her head, it feels warm\nlike the sun, right?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0701_04_10": "Looking at Chikorita always reminds me of Johto!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0702_01_10": "I guess a person’s hometown is a special place\nto them.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0601_0702_02_10": "I wonder how Grandpa and Grandma are doing.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0602_0701_01_10": "Do you know the Pokémon named Marill?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0602_0701_02_10": "It’s a great Pokémon I met back in Johto!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0602_0701_03_10": "It’s got a round body like a balloon. \nDon’t you think that makes it really cute?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0602_0702_01_10": "One time, my Marill fell in the mud.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0602_0702_02_10": "And when I caught a whiff of its scent, it smelled\nlike a dust mop! I was so surprised!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0701_01_10": "Seems like even here there’s a lot of people\nwho know the Johto dialect.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0701_02_10": "When other people use the dialect, it starts to\nslip out of me, too!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0701_03_10": "Do you know Valerie, from Laverre City? Do you\nthink it’d be cute to talk the way she does?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0702_01_10": "The Johto region has a lot of really old towns.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0702_02_10": "I guess traveling the world makes me realize the\ngood stuff about where I’m from.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0603_0702_03_10": "Hmm, could I be feeling a little homesick?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0701_01_10": "Seems like even if you become a great Trainer,\nthere’ll always be people wanting to \nchallenge you.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0701_02_10": "Red always gets challenged to Pokémon battles.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0701_03_10": "Sometimes I think I’m a little jealous of him.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0701_04_10": "If you’re always battling, \nthen there’s no time to play!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0702_01_10": "Since we’re on the topic, maybe I should\nchallenge Red, too.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0604_0702_02_10": "We battled before, but was it really a\ngreat battle?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0701_01_10": "I sometimes forget that I’m the senior Trainer\nwhen I’m with you, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0701_02_10": "Sometimes it looks like you get along with your\nPokémon better than me, too...",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0701_03_10": "and you’ve helped me in Pokémon battles\nsometimes, too.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0701_04_10": "OK! I’m going to give it my best so that you\ndon’t surpass me anymore!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0702_01_10": "You can ask me, your senior Trainer,\nanything you want to know, OK?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/0605_0702_02_10": "I’ll show you that I can become\na senior you can count on!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/1701_0701_01_10": "Ah! Here it is! Have this! It’s a present\nfrom me!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/1701_0701_02_10": "I used it a long time ago, but I’m OK with\ngiving it to you!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/1701_0702_01_10": "I know it’s a hand-me-down, but I’m sure it’ll\nreally come in handy!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/1701_0702_02_10": "I’ve got a lot of memories with that item, so\ntake good care of it!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_01_10": "Hey, so what’s your relationship with Red like?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_02_10": "Oh, that was out of the blue, wasn’t it?\nI don’t mean anything weird!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_03_10": "There’s something about you that reminds me\nof Red, but I can’t quite put my finger on it...",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_04_10": "Maybe it’s how seriously you take battles or\nthe way you refuse to lose.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0701_05_10": "It could also be the way you interact \nwith your Pokémon. You really cherish \nyour Pokémon, don’t you?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0702_01_10": "I think you can definitely get as strong as Red!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2501_0702_02_10": "I guarantee it!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0701_01_10": "Today, as your senior, I’ll give you advice on\nwhatever you want!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0701_02_10": "If you’re worried or troubled about anything,\njust let me know!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0701_03_10": "Really? Nothing?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0701_04_10": "Does this mean I’m an unreliable senior?",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0701_05_10": "Ah! It turns out, I’ve got something I’m\nworried about!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0702_01_10": "It turns out, acting like your senior is\npretty difficult.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/2511_0702_02_10": "Hmm.\nMaybe I should try to act more like myself.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! Great day, isn’t it. Come on.\nLet’s head out together with our Pokémon!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3002_0701_01_10": "I woke up super early.\nI just couldn’t wait to see where I’d go today!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3003_0701_01_10": "I’m a bit tired...\nGuess I was wandering around a little too much.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3004_0701_01_10": "I feel like taking a nap, but it just seems like\nsuch a waste to...sleep.",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3005_0701_01_10": "I bet exploring at night would be fun, too!\nOh man, now I wanna head out!",
    "ch0002_00_kotone/3006_0701_01_10": "Look at all the pretty stars!\nI bet trying to count them all would put\nyou to sleep in no time... *yawn*"
