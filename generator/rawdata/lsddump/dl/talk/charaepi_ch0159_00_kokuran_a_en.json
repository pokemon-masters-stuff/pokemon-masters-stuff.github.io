    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_0300_10": "Greetings, [Name:PlayerNickname ] and\nLady Cynthia. I was just returning from\ngrocery shopping.",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_0500_10": "You never change, do you, Darach?",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_0600_10": "As embarrassing as it is to admit, Lady Cynthia,\nyou are indeed correct—this is my nature.",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0301_0700_10": "Was there some problem?",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0302_0900_10": "Your nature?",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0402_1000_10": "It is extremely difficult to break oneself of habits\nthat one has developed over many years... *sigh*",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_1300_10": "It is for that reason that I have not been\npurchasing her favorite tea...",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_1700_10": "And yet, I must admit that thinking about the\nsituation in such terms makes me feel\nquite lonely...",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0401_1900_10": "I am grateful. I suppose you could say that where\none door closes, another opens.",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0302_2000_10": "We’ll help you out!",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0402_2100_10": "Thank you. That does make me feel rather better.",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_2200_10": "Lady Caitlin has made many new, wonderful\nfriends like you since she came to Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_2300_10": "It’s a complicated feeling, to be unable to tend to\nmy lady when she needs my help.",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_2400_10": "I have a favor to ask you. If it’s not too much\ntrouble, could you please continue to be Lady\nCaitlin’s friend, now and into the future?",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0302_2700_10": "Naturally!",
    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_0402_2800_10": "Of course. I suppose I needn’t have asked you to\ndo that which you already intended.",

    "charaepi_ch0159_00_kokuran_a/2301_1201_3400_10": "Oh, dear. It’s never easy watching a fledgling\nleave the nest.",
