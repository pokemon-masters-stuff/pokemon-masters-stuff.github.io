    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_0200_10": "Hey, Luxray! Stop trying to pull me away!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_0300_10": "I just want to look inside! I promise I’ll put it back\nthe way it was!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0301_0400_10": "What are you doing?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0401_0500_10": "Oh, hello there. I was just trying to take a look at\nthis machine, but Luxray stopped me.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0302_0600_10": "Doing some renovations?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0402_0700_10": "Unfortunately, no. I just wanted to get a better\nlook at this machine here.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_0800_10": "I tried to do something similar back when I first\narrived on Pasio, and one of the scientists here\nreally gave me an earful.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_0900_10": "I assume that’s why Luxray is trying to stop me.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1000_10": "But I’m so interested in the technology they used\nto create such an enormous artificial island that I\njust can’t help myself.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1100_10": "I just want to peek under the hood and see how it\nall works. That’s not renovating anything, is it?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1200_10": "Oh, come on! Of all the times for this to happen!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0301_1300_10": "What’s wrong?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0401_1400_10": "I’m in a real pinch, that’s what’s wrong!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0302_1500_10": "What happened?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0402_1600_10": "Something bad! Really bad!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1700_10": "Our microwave at the cafe broke, and now it’s\ntaking forever to prep for lunch.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1800_10": "You don’t say? Well, it just so happens that I’m\nquite good at renova—er, repairs. Maybe I can\nbe of assistance.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_1900_10": "Really?! Thank you! The cafe is over this way!",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2000_10": "A job well done.\nOh, hello again, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nWere you waiting for me to finish?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0301_2100_10": "Did you fix the microwave?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0401_2200_10": "Of course. It was a shockingly easy fix. One of the\nparts had simply gotten knocked loose.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0302_2300_10": "Did you find out what was broken?",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_0402_2400_10": "Yes. One of the parts had gotten knocked loose,\nwhich was causing the microwave to malfunction.\nShockingly easy fix, really.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2500_10": "Luxray has the ability to see through all kinds of\nobjects, you know. So I was able to see what\nneeded to be fixed, no problem.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2600_10": "It sure would be helpful if he’d use that ability to\nhelp me renovate—uh, I mean, carefully analyze\nthe machines on Pasio, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2700_10": "But on the bright side, I’ve been renovating so\nmany complex machines lately that fixing a simple\nkitchen appliance was a nice change of pace.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2800_10": "Stuff like that helps me remember why I got into\nrenovating machines in the first place.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_2900_10": "It’s good to remember your roots. That’s true even\nof Pokémon battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3000_10": "There was a time when I had nearly forgotten\nhow to enjoy Pokémon battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3100_10": "But then I battled this one Trainer, and it was like\nI could suddenly remember why I enjoyed them\nso much.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3200_10": "After that, I decided I wanted the Trainers I face\nto enjoy Pokémon battles just as much as I do.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3300_10": "I think Luxray really enjoys battles, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3400_10": "No matter how tired or sleepy he is, when it’s\ntime to battle, it’s like a switch flips on inside him.",
    "charaepi_ch0115_00_denji/2301_1201_3500_10": "The two of us will never stop having fun,\nshocking battles!"
