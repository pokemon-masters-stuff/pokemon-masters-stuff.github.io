    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_0500_10": "No wonder you two make such a great team!",

    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1500_10": "If that’s true, then I owe a lot to the people and\nPokémon I met back in Unova and here on Pasio.\nThey helped me become who I am today.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4001_1201_1600_10": "You think so, too, Reshiram?",

    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0200_10": "They look just like the statues at the Parfum Palace\nback in Kalos!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0300_10": "You’re right. How very intriguing!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0400_10": "Are you curious about Reshiram and Zekrom?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0500_10": "Yeah! We have statues of both of them in the\nKalos region.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0600_10": "It is said that Reshiram and Zekrom were involved\nin Unova’s creation...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0700_10": "whereas Xerneas and Yveltal are said to have had\na hand in Kalos’s destruction.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0800_10": "Two regions—each with two Legendary Pokémon\nthat played a huge role in their region’s history...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_0900_10": "It sounds like the myths of our homelands share\nquite a few similarities.",

    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1100_10": "I think it would be interesting to investigate how\nthe myths of Unova made it over to Kalos in the\nfirst place.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1200_10": "I’d be curious to see how the tale of these two\nmade it all the way there as well.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4002_1201_1300_10": "Maybe Reshiram, Zekrom, and I will have to pay\nKalos a visit sometime.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0100_10": "Lunala is a moon Pokémon, isn’t it?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0200_10": "When it spreads its wings, they almost look like\ncrescent moons. It’s so pretty!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0300_10": "Lunatone is shaped like a crescent moon, too!\nHow adorable!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0400_10": "Aww! Look how happy it looks!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0500_10": "Maybe it likes the way Lunala made a circle with\nits wings.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0600_10": "Lunatone is always full of energy when the moon\nis at its fullest!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0700_10": "Do you think Lunatone may have mistaken my\nLunala for the real moon? That’s so cute.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0800_10": "I bet the two of them would make the best of\nfriends. Moon Pokémon are bound to get along\nwith each other, right?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_0900_10": "I think so! They’d make a cosmic combination\nfor sure!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4003_1201_1000_10": "We should team up together! That sounds like it\nwould be so much fun!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0100_10": "What’s the matter, Rayquaza? Are you curious\nabout Eternatus?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0200_10": "It’s acting like it does when it sees a meteorite...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0300_10": "Oh, is Rayquaza attracted to meteorites?\nInteresting...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0400_10": "They say that Eternatus arrived to the planet inside\na meteorite that fell in ancient times!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0500_10": "Maybe it’s got a meteorite-like energy about it\nbecause of that!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0600_10": "That would make sense...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0700_10": "In any case, it seems your partner has sparked\na flame within Rayquaza.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0800_10": "Shall we sate its curiosity with a battle?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_0900_10": "I never refuse a challenge!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_1000_10": "A legendary face-off between two Legendary\nPokémon... This ought to be good!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_1100_10": "Sounds like Eternatus is keen as well!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4004_1201_1200_10": "Come on, Rayquaza! Let’s show these two how\nstrong we are!",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0100_10": "I assume you came to watch the gala?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0200_10": "Pshh, I couldn’t care less about it.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0300_10": "But my Rayquaza here seems to be very interested\nin yours.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0400_10": "What a coincidence. My Rayquaza seems quite\ninterested in yours as well.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0500_10": "Maybe it’s natural for Rayquaza to be drawn to\nother Rayquaza.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0600_10": "Who knows?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0700_10": "Appearance isn’t everything. They could look\ntotally different from one another and still be\ndrawn to each other.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0800_10": "True... You may be right about that.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_0900_10": "Well, good talk. I’ve got places to be...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1000_10": "But you’ve only just arrived! Why not stay and\nenjoy the gala for a while?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1100_10": "Listen. I’m not here to make friends, all right?",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1200_10": "But there is something we’re gonna need to clear\nup here pretty soon.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1300_10": "And that’s which one of our Rayquaza is stronger.\nAnd cooler.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1400_10": "I’ll be looking forward to it.",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_anniversary_2021/4005_1201_1500_10": "Rayquaza and I will blow your imagination away!"
