    "ch0017_00_leaf/0101_0701_02_10": "Make sure you take good care of it, all right?\nDon’t push it more than necessary.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0601_0701_01_10": "I’ll protect my Pokémon no matter what.\nThat’s my golden rule.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0601_0701_02_10": "Why? Because he chose me. Out of everybody\nelse, he chose me to be his Trainer.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0601_0701_03_10": "That alone makes me want to protect him\nfrom anything!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0601_0702_01_10": "Seeing somebody important to me get hurt\nis so much worse than getting hurt myself!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0601_0702_02_10": "I think you understand that feeling well.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0602_0701_01_10": "You see a lot of Trainers keep their Pokémon\nout of their Poké Balls on Pasio, right?",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0602_0701_02_10": "I’m glad to be able to walk around with\nmy Eevee, but it does worry me a bit...",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0602_0701_03_10": "He’s just too cute!\nSomebody might want to kidnap him!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0602_0702_01_10": "Or maybe a talent agent might want to make\nhim a Pokémon model! Would that mean we\ncouldn’t be together anymore?!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0602_0702_02_10": "Oh no! Wh-where’d I put his Poké Ball?!\nI have to protect him!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0701_01_10": "There are a lot of great things about Pasio,\nbut I think some of the most impressive things\nare the different smells.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0701_02_10": "The scent of flowers wafts from the forest,\ncarried by the wind.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0701_03_10": "Sometimes I stop to get lost in the aroma of\nthe flowers.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0701_04_10": "And then I realize that everybody’s staring at me\nlike I’m a weirdo.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0702_01_10": "You can smell delicious smells coming from\nthe city, and you can smell the salt from the\nocean breeze.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0603_0702_02_10": "Man, I just can’t get enough of Pasio!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0701_01_10": "There are a lot of Rattata around Pallet Town in\nKanto. That’s where I’m from.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0701_02_10": "This one time long ago, one snuck into our kitchen!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0701_03_10": "It nibbled on so much of our food...\nI couldn’t believe what was happening when I\nwalked through the door!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0701_04_10": "While it did surprise me, that Rattata looked so\nhappy eating, I couldn’t get angry at it!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0702_01_10": "I travel around with my Pokémon and spend all my\ntime with them, but I always find new surprises!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0702_02_10": "It makes me want to know about Pokémon\neven more!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0604_0702_03_10": "Maybe that’s just the nature of being a Trainer?",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey! I think I just figured something out!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0701_02_10": "You know how my Eevee is super cute?",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0701_03_10": "Not only that—he’s so strong! Like, nobody\ncan even touch him!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0701_04_10": "Is it possible...that we’re the strongest?",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0702_01_10": "Maybe you can be my rival,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/0605_0702_02_10": "You take good care of your partner Pokémon,\nand you’ve got some real talent when it comes\nto battling.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/1701_0701_01_10": "Found ya!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/1701_0701_02_10": "I wanted to give this to you!\nI’m sure it’ll come in handy!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/1701_0702_01_10": "Well, I’m off! Take care of yourself!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2501_0701_01_10": "Eevee’s front paws are soooooo fluffy and soft!\nIt feels great to just squeeze them!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2501_0701_02_10": "They’re so small and cute, but they have so much\npower behind them, too.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2501_0701_03_10": "He’s always so reliable, but at the same time,\nI can’t help but feel really protective of him!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2501_0702_01_10": "Pokémon have a very mysterious charm\nabout them.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2501_0702_02_10": "Aah, I love him sooo much... I just can’t even—",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0701_01_10": "Right now, I’m really into making different\nflower crowns for my Eevee.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0701_02_10": "I pick flowers that might look good on him, and\nwhen I put them on his head, sometimes he cries\nout happily and other times he doesn’t react at all.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0701_03_10": "That means he has preferences, too, right?\nI should take notes next time!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0702_01_10": "What kinds of flowers do you think Eevee would\nlike best?",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0702_02_10": "Maybe I should have him choose for me when\nI make my next flower crown.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/2511_0702_03_10": "Heh heh! I’m already getting excited!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3001_0701_01_10": "Sometimes I wish Trainers could use\nphotosynthesis, too. I would just spread out my\narms and soak up the sun.",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3002_0701_01_10": "Nothing like early morning sunshine to wake me\nup and fill me with energy for the day!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3003_0701_01_10": "You know, I’m glad I came to Pasio. There’re so\nmany different Trainers and Pokémon to meet!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3004_0701_01_10": "Everywhere you look, the scenery here on Pasio\nis so gorgeous! It would be a waste to stay\ncooped up inside all day!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3005_0701_01_10": "Everything seems a little bit different at night,\ndon’t you think? Pasio, Pokémon...even people!",
    "ch0017_00_leaf/3006_0701_01_10": "You’d think I would hate the dark, but actually I\ndon’t! There are lots of Pokémon that can only be\nfound at night!"
