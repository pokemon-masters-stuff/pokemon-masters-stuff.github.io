    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0701_01_10": "I make sure that I never stop improving...\nboth as a Trainer and as a model.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0701_03_10": "Once I do that, I set specific, small goals that I can\nachieve to get to my ultimate goal.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0701_04_10": "Then, I have to keep my will strong and keep\nmoving forward...\nNice and simple, right?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0702_01_10": "It can definitely be difficult to achieve the goals\nthat you set for yourself.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0702_02_10": "I mean, even I’m no stranger to failure.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0601_0702_03_10": "Whenever that happens...\nthe best thing you can do is to keep going and tell\nyourself that you’ll do better next time.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0701_02_10": "I’ve always found that weird. I feel like you’d\nmore likely forget things if you were actually hit\nby electricity, right?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0701_03_10": "*giggle*\nDo you want to try it out?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0702_01_10": "I’m only joking. I wouldn’t actually think of\nelectrocuting anybody.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0702_02_10": "But wouldn’t it be wonderful to be an electrifying\ninspiration for people?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0602_0702_03_10": "I hope to become like that someday, both\nas a model and as a Trainer.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0603_0702_01_10": "Rotom can be a pain in the neck, but its pranks\nkeep everything fresh for me!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0603_0702_02_10": "Rotom’s serious when it comes to having fun!\nIt’s easy to forget how important that is.\nWe can all learn a thing or two from Rotom.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_01_10": "The designer who made this outfit totally\ngets me.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_02_10": "Just a pretty outfit would be boring, and just\nan eccentric one wouldn’t be satisfying enough.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_03_10": "But this outfit has the perfect balance between\nbeauty and eccentricity.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0701_04_10": "I literally cannot even.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0604_0702_01_10": "This outfit totally fits my lifestyle in every way.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0701_02_10": "The most dazzling stories are written after\nthe characters meet, right?",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0701_03_10": "And only when they’ve had a beautiful story\nwritten about them, then they can decide whether\ntheir meeting was fated or not.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0702_01_10": "I wonder what kind of story will be written about\nRotom and me...or you and me...",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0702_02_10": "Of course, we can never know what the future\nhas in store for us.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/0605_0702_03_10": "And that can be a little scary, but I think it’s more\nexciting than anything!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/1701_0701_01_10": "I’d like you to have this.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0701_03_10": "But sometimes, Skyla chooses some weird\noutfits for me to try on.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0701_04_10": "I guess it’s fine. I get to try out all sorts of outfits,\nand Skyla seems to really enjoy it.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0702_01_10": "Skyla has such good style. I think she could totally\nbe a model, too, if she wanted to.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2501_0702_02_10": "It’d be really fun if we could walk the same\ncatwalk someday.",

    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0701_04_10": "You’re so earnest and kind, as a Trainer and just\nas a person.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0702_01_10": "I’ve never seen you be anything but nice to the\npeople and Pokémon around you.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/2511_0702_02_10": "I say this without any sarcasm. It’s what makes\nyou so dazzling.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3001_0701_01_10": "Sometimes I have to wake up super early,\ndepending on what outfit I’m gonna wear.\nPerfection takes time!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3002_0701_01_10": "The air’s so clean and fresh here...\nIt feels good to take a nice, deep breath.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3003_0701_01_10": "It’s always super lively here around this time.\nSo many Trainers to chat with!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3004_0701_01_10": "I’m going for perfect posture—it makes me look\nthat much more fierce!",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3005_0701_01_10": "On nights when I can’t sleep, I step outside,\nspread my arms, and bathe in the\nmoon’s spotlight.",
    "ch0106_10_kamitsure/3006_0701_01_10": "Phew! My skin must be glistening after that\ntraining session... Time to cool down so I can\ndo the same routine again tomorrow."
