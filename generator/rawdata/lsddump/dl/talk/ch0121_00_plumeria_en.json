    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0101_0701_02_10": "Not that I hate that or anything. I’m looking\nforward to seeing what kind of trouble you cause.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0701_01_10": "I’ve been walking around town a lot since I got\nto Pasio.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0701_02_10": "When I walk around in Alola looking like this,\npeople get scared of me.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0701_03_10": "That doesn’t happen as much here. It’s a pretty\nrefreshing feeling.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0702_01_10": "Before, I’d always have to do annoying work, like\ndealing with whatever dumb thing the Grunts did.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0702_02_10": "I never had a moment to myself, but now I’ve got\na ton of time to enjoy doing whatever I want.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0601_0702_03_10": "I wonder how those numskulls are doing... It’s not\nlike I’m really worried or anything.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0602_0701_01_10": "The poisonous gas my partner Pokémon Salazzle\nreleases can be used to make perfume.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0602_0701_02_10": "As it is, it’s dangerous, but if you dilute it, it\nbecomes a great-smelling perfume.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0602_0701_03_10": "Hm? What kind of scent does it have? You’re too\nyoung to be interested in things like that.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0602_0702_01_10": "You think it’s weird that a Poison-type Pokémon\ncan make perfume? That’s what’s so interesting\nabout Salazzle.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0602_0702_02_10": "Everyone being different is what makes things\ninteresting. That’s true for people and Pokémon.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0603_0701_01_10": "There’s a proper strategy for every Pokémon\nin battle.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0603_0701_02_10": "For example, being poisoned slowly drains a\nPokémon of its energy.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0603_0701_03_10": "There’s more to battling than just using brainless\nforce. Battling with your head is good, too.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0603_0702_01_10": "You battle pretty well. It’s impressive.\nKind of dignified.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0603_0702_02_10": "I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of\nTrainer you become.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0604_0701_01_10": "The guys in Team Skull just don’t know how to live\ntheir lives. Just dummies doing dumb things.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0604_0701_02_10": "They’ve just wandered and gotten a little bit\nlost for a time, is all.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0604_0701_03_10": "It’s my duty to protect them and keep them on\nthe right path.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0604_0702_01_10": "Don’t know if that really makes me a leader or\nwhatever, though.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0604_0702_02_10": "I think it’s more that I’m just nice enough to keep\nTeam Skull together so they don’t go off on their\nown and do anything stupid.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0701_01_10": "Team Skull’s completely full of idiots.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0701_02_10": "But don’t you think some dummies are cute in\ntheir dumbness?",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0701_03_10": "For some reason, I just can’t abandon those guys.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0702_01_10": "You seemed pretty boring when we first met,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0702_02_10": "But it turns out you’re strong and you’ve got some\nserious guts.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/0605_0702_03_10": "Don’t get the wrong idea—mess with anyone\nin Team Skull, and I’ll show you how serious I \ncan get.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/1701_0701_01_10": "Here. Shut up and take this.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/1701_0701_02_10": "It could be useful, though that depends on you.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/1701_0702_01_10": "You’re free to choose how you use it. Do what\nyou want.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0701_01_10": "Pasio’s towns sure have a lot of different shops.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0701_02_10": "I’m really interested in the makeup and plushies\nyou can’t find around Alola.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0701_03_10": "What? Got a problem with me being into that\nkind of stuff?",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0702_01_10": "I’ve got quite a bit of stuff like that back in my\nroom at Team Skull’s base.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0702_02_10": "Adding the things I buy on Pasio to that collection\nsounds like fun.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2501_0702_03_10": "Come shopping with me next time.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2511_0701_01_10": "A long time ago, someone in town tried to pick a\nfight with me.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2511_0701_02_10": "Another person saved me by challenging them to a\nPokémon battle.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2511_0701_03_10": "I really...admired that compassion.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2511_0702_01_10": "Pain, failure—it’s not easy when things don’t go\nthe way you’d like.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/2511_0702_02_10": "I don’t think I’d admire that person as much as I do\nif they were strong and nothing else.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3001_0701_01_10": "Oh... Sorry, kinda busy right now. I’ve pretty much\ndedicated my whole day to cleaning up my room.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3002_0701_01_10": "When I see numskulls slacking off first thing in\nthe morning, it’s hard not to go over and\nstraighten ’em out!",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3003_0701_01_10": "I think my Pokémon’s really starting to like this\nplace... I guess it’s growing on me, too.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3004_0701_01_10": "The quickest way to get stronger is to train with\nyour Pokémon every day—no excuses.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3005_0701_01_10": "Hm? You wanna go sightseeing? That’s cool. I just\nprefer to laze around in the afternoon, personally.",
    "ch0121_00_plumeria/3006_0701_01_10": "Not sure if I approve of you walking around at\nnight... Holler at me if anything spooks you,\nall right?"
