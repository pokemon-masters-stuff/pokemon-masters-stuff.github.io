    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_0300_10": "Oh, hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Why do ya\nlook so shocked? Somethin’ wrong?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_0400_10": "Morpeko’s appearance? Oh, did ya see all that\njust now?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_0500_10": "My partner Pokémon, Morpeko, changes\nappearance based on how hungry she is.",

    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_0800_10": "but I ran out while walkin’ around and lookin’ in\nall the apparel shops in town.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_0900_10": "It’s OK, though, because the sync pair I was just\ntalkin’ to shared some of theirs with me!",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_1000_10": "You’re still hungry? I guess I’ve gotta go search\nfor some Berries, then...",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_1100_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ], help me look for\na bit, would ya?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0301_1200_10": "Sure!",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0401_1300_10": "Thanks! Let’s get goin’, then, shall we?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0302_1400_10": "Sounds fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0402_1500_10": "Glad to hear it. It’d be a great help to have\nsomeone searchin’ with me.",

    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0401_1800_10": "Yeah. My legs got tired real quick, too, when I\nfirst started doin’ this.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0302_1900_10": "I bet this is great training for us.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0402_2000_10": "I bet you’re right. It’s practically like workin’ out.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_2100_10": "It doesn’t bother me anymore, though. I’ve been\ndoin’ this ever since I teamed up with Morpeko\nwhen I was five years old, y’know.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_2200_10": "My big brother caught my Morpeko for me way\nback then, when all I did was cry all the time.",

    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_2500_10": "But I bet you won’t find any sync pair out there\nwith a bond stronger than ours.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_2600_10": "Well, I guess all the sync pairs here on Pasio\nprobably say the same thing, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_2700_10": "So I know I can’t just rely on our bond. We’ve\ngotta keep trainin’ to get stronger if we wanna\nbeat all the other sync pairs here.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_0301_2800_10": "I’m cheering for you!",

    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_3200_10": "OK, then. I guess we’ve gathered about enough.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_3300_10": "Thanks for your help, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nWith this many Berries, we should be fine for a\nlittle while at least.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_3400_10": "Hmm... How can I thank you?",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_3500_10": "I know! I’ll be your trainin’ partner the next time\nyou go out to train.",
    "charaepi_ch0245_00_mary/2301_1201_3600_10": "We can cheer each other on and both get stronger\ntogether. It’ll be great, y’know?",
