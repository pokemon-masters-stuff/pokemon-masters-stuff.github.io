    "ch0051_00_litchi/0101_0701_02_10": "I hope you have surprises and inspiration in your\nadventures today.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0601_0701_01_10": "You like my necklace? I think it’s pretty, too!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0601_0701_02_10": "Believe it or not, I run a jewelry shop \non the side—while also being a kahuna.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0601_0701_03_10": "And sometimes, keeping the raw and rough\nedges makes the jewels look fancier!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0601_0702_01_10": "If you ever find yourself interested in jewelry,\ncome to my shop!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0601_0702_02_10": "The wares might be pricy, but my selection\nis top-of-the-line!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0701_01_10": "Are you eating properly? Pokémon battles drain\nTrainers as well as Pokémon.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0701_02_10": "I eat well so I can battle well anyplace\nand anytime.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0701_03_10": "Maybe that’s why I like a person who\nappreciates good food!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0702_01_10": "I would totally recommend the Z-sets\nyou can get in Alola!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0702_02_10": "They really pile food onto your plate, and they use\ntasty family recipes. They’re my favorite!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0602_0702_03_10": "Though I hear that some people are just after\nthe Heart Scales that come along with the dish!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0701_01_10": "Golem from the Alola region look different \nthan ones from other regions.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0701_02_10": "They throw electrified rocks.\nIsn’t that pretty neat?",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0701_03_10": "And those electrified rocks shine like jewels and\nare really pretty.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0701_04_10": "Beautiful and strong! That’s what I really like\nabout that move.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0702_01_10": "There are a lot of Pokémon that you can only\nsee in the Alola region.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0603_0702_02_10": "If you find any Trainers from Alola, maybe you\ncan ask them to show you their Pokémon.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0701_01_10": "My trusty partner is the rough ’n’ tough Lycanroc!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0701_02_10": "He’s flexible and kindhearted.\nIn a way, he’s the opposite of me.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0701_03_10": "But that’s why I’m drawn to him.\nI think it’s the same for him, too.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0701_04_10": "That being said, all my Pokémon are adorable!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0701_05_10": "They’re like my children.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0702_01_10": "I like soft and cute things.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0604_0702_02_10": "I even collect Stufful and other Pokémon plush.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0701_01_10": "I might be the kahuna, but really, I’m just your\naverage girl, you know?",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0701_02_10": "So you can be more relaxed around me, OK?",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0701_03_10": "Wouldn’t it make it easier for both of us if\nwe just acted natural around each other?",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0701_04_10": "At the least, it would make me happier if we\ncould be like that.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0702_01_10": "Being laid-back is the best for both people and\nPokémon. Always being proper is so tiring.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/0605_0702_02_10": "If you’re ever in a jam, talk to each other, and \nwhen things are calm, laugh with each other. \nThat kind of relationship is the best!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/1701_0701_01_10": "You got a moment?\n",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/1701_0701_02_10": "You’ve been working really hard, so here’s a\npresent from yours truly.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/1701_0702_01_10": "Don’t worry about it! I’m munificent like that!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/1701_0702_02_10": "Oh, “munificent” means generous.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0701_01_10": "Thanks to the fact that I’m both a kahuna and a\nmember of the Elite Four...",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0701_02_10": "I get to meet all sorts of Trainers, but it’s never\non this kind of scale.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0701_03_10": "Thanks to the PML, I’m having so much fun\ninteracting with Trainers from all over the world.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0701_04_10": "You don’t get this kind of experience very often,\nso make sure you enjoy yourself while you can!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0702_01_10": "With there being so many people from all over\nthe world...",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2501_0702_02_10": "maybe I can find somebody special myself.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0701_01_10": "You really do keep growing stronger, don’t you!\nIt’s really satisfying to watch!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0701_02_10": "At this rate, you might even be able to reach the\napex of all Trainers.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0701_03_10": "You have that much potential!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0702_01_10": "Your team members trust you \nbecause of your strength.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0702_02_10": "Even I’m drawn to your strength and\nyour personality.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/2511_0702_03_10": "I want you to show me more of your Pokémon\nbattles in the future, too!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3001_0701_01_10": "Alola! Today looks like it’s going\nto be a lovely day, doesn’t it.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3002_0701_01_10": "*yawn* I think I slept in a little too late today...\nIt’s tough being a grown-up.",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3003_0701_01_10": "Alola! Have you felt the breeze outside today?\nIt’s just lovely!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3004_0701_01_10": "I’ve got some kahuna errands I need to\nrun today, but I kinda want to relax and\nhave fun with you instead!",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3005_0701_01_10": "Alola! Aren’t you a little young to be out and\nabout this late?",
    "ch0051_00_litchi/3006_0701_01_10": "The stars are beautiful tonight,\nand the air is so clear here."
