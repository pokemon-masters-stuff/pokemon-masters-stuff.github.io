    "ch0113_40_mikan/0101_0701_02_10": "I don’t know how to say this, but good luck...",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7101_0701_01_10": "Isn’t this new outfit just wonderful?",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7101_0701_02_10": "A lot of people say it looks heavy, but it really\nisn’t that bad.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7101_0701_03_10": "Celesteela is much, much heavier!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7102_0701_01_10": "I think that the hair accessory I have on is really\ncute. Every time I move, it swishes.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7102_0701_02_10": "Maybe I should give a matching one to Celesteela!",

    "ch0113_40_mikan/7103_0701_04_10": "If these aren’t colorful enough, then what in the\nworld is?",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7104_0701_01_10": "My costume matches Celesteela’s look.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7104_0701_02_10": "Just like a Steel-type Pokémon, I’m... You know...\nClang!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7104_0701_03_10": "D-don’t I look very hard, cold, and sharp?",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7105_0701_01_10": "Um... What do you think about Celesteela,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7105_0701_02_10": "Sometimes people get frightened of Celesteela\nbecause it’s an Ultra Beast.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7105_0701_03_10": "I really want people to know that they have\nnothing to be afraid of. Celesteela isn’t scary.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/7105_0701_04_10": "So I’ll go anywhere and do anything I can to show\nhow great Celesteela is!",

    "ch0113_40_mikan/2501_0701_02_10": "Did you know that Celesteela weighs a whopping\n2,204.4 pounds?",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2501_0701_03_10": "Isn’t it amazing that Celesteela can fly even\nthough it’s so heavy?!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2501_0702_01_10": "I have this dream that I haven’t shared with\nanyone yet...",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2501_0702_02_10": "Someday, I want to go on an adventure with\nCelesteela, flying around to all the different\nregions.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2501_0702_03_10": "I know it would be a really, really amazing\nadventure!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2511_0701_01_10": "Celesteela and Steelix spend lots of time together.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2511_0701_02_10": "Sometimes they look like they’re discussing\nsomething. Other times, it looks like they’re\nshowing off their polished bodies...",

    "ch0113_40_mikan/2511_0702_01_10": "I often see Celesteela and Steelix together right\nafter I’ve polished their bodies...",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2511_0702_02_10": "Maybe they really are showing off their shine\nto each other.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/2511_0702_03_10": "If that’s so, I’d better start polishing them even\nmore often than I do now!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/3001_0701_01_10": "Sometimes when I accidentally brush up against\nmy Pokémon in the morning, their steel is so cold\nthat it wakes me right up!",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/3003_0701_01_10": "I always keep a close eye on my Pokémon’s\nhealth and well-being. I’d be so upset if one\ngot hurt or sick.",
    "ch0113_40_mikan/3005_0701_01_10": "I think it’s really important for Trainers and\nPokémon to join together...with one heart and\none mind."
