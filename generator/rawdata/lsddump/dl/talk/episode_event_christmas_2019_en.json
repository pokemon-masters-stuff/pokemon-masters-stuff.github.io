    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0200_10": "Yep! My sources tell me he’s a legendary chef\nwho’s looking for an assistant on Pasio...and my\nsources don’t lie!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0300_10": "All right, then! Let’s go find him!\nHe should be around here somewhere...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0400_10": "You know, you really are amazing, Rosa!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0500_10": "Huh? Wh-where’d that come from?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0600_10": "The fact that you thought of throwing a party\nfor all your teammates and you want to give\neveryone a home-cooked meal...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0700_10": "and you want to go study under a top-notch chef\nso that everything’s perfect... I mean, you’re really\ngoing the extra mile!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0800_10": "Y-you think so? I just figured that if I was gonna\ncook for everyone, I should make something tasty.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_0900_10": "And that’s what’s so amazing about you! Let me\nknow if there’s anything you need help with, OK?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1000_10": "Thanks, Maylene! I know I can always count\non you.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1100_10": "Anytime! I’m bummed we haven’t run into\nSiebold yet, though...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1200_10": "Hey... Did you just say Siebold?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1300_10": "Oh, hello! You wouldn’t happen to know where\nwe could find him, would you?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1400_10": "I believe he should be just up ahead...\nBut tell me, do you seek to train under Siebold as\nan apprentice as well?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1500_10": "Apprentice... If you’re talking about the\nassistant chef position, then yes!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1600_10": "Hmph... That changes things. I am afraid this is\nthe end of the road for you.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1700_10": "Huh?! What’s that supposed to mean?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1800_10": "Many hopeful applicants, myself included, have\ntraveled here today for the chance to learn the\ntechniques of a legendary chef.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_1900_10": "However, I heard that Siebold only wishes to take\non a single apprentice... Therefore, I must kick\nmy rivals out of the running here and now.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_2000_10": "No way... I’m not gonna give up and go home\nbefore I’ve even had the chance to meet Chef\nSiebold in person!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_2100_10": "Errgh! Then you leave me no choice... The path to\nbecoming a master chef is a brutal one. Leave\nnow, or I will strike hard and without mercy!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_2200_10": "Come on, Rosa, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nLet’s take him on!\nWe can’t let bullies like him go unchecked!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4001_1001_2300_10": "Besides, I’m a martial artist myself! It would be\ndishonorable to run away from a challenge!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0100_10": "Ahh, new customers. Welcome, welcome!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0200_10": "A-actually, um, I’m here to apply to be your\nassistant chef, Siebold!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0300_10": "Ah, I see. I didn’t realize you were a candidate.\nWell then, I have one question for you...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0400_10": "I’ve asked this question to everyone who has\napplied for the position so far, and that is...\nwhy do you wish to work with me?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0500_10": "Well... This is something I want to do for\nmy friends.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0600_10": "Is that so?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0700_10": "Yep! Rosa’s throwing a party for her friends,\nand she wants to serve everyone delicious\nhome-cooked food.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0800_10": "That’s why I want to be your assistant chef—\nso I can learn to cook something fantastic!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_0900_10": "What delightful ambition! I can tell you have a\nknack for service and hospitality.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1000_10": "Does that mean you’ll take her on?!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1100_10": "Well, she’s passed the interview portion of the\napplication, but now I’d like to see what she’s\ncapable of in action.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1200_10": "In action... You mean you want me to show you\nwhat cooking skills I already have?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1300_10": "No, no. I’d like to see your Pokémon battling skills\nin action!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1400_10": "Huh? A Pokémon battle?! What does Pokémon\nbattling have to do with cooking?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1500_10": "Everything! The two may seem different on the\nsurface, but deep down both are forms of art\nthat share the same philosophy.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1600_10": "The end results only last for a few brief, passing\nmoments, so we devote ourselves to making those\nmoments last in our memories forever.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1700_10": "So your theory is...if you watch me battle, you’ll\nunderstand my philosophy on cooking, too?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1800_10": "Precisely. Now, the final question is...\nwill you indulge my curiosity?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_1900_10": "To be honest, I’m still pretty confused about all\nof this, but I’ll give it a shot!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_2000_10": "I guess my philosophy is...to always put my heart\nand soul into every battle. I’ll do my best!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4003_1001_2100_10": "I’d expect nothing less! Now, prove it to me\nin action!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0100_10": "What a delectable battle. Well done!\nYour love and passion shined through each\nand every move.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0200_10": "Does that mean...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0300_10": "You’re hired! I’d be delighted to have you on\nas an assistant chef, Rosa.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0400_10": "Really?! This is so amazing! Thank you so much!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0500_10": "The pleasure is all mine. Now, shall we go ahead\nand start prepping for—",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0600_10": "Hey there! I heard you’re in need of a\ntalented cook!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0700_10": "Hm? And you are...?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0800_10": "Mallow here, at your service! I came to apply for\nthe open assistant chef position!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_0900_10": "Ah, another candidate! My deepest apologies,\nbut the position has already been filled.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1000_10": "What?! You already hired someone?!\nAw, darn... I was really hoping I’d get the\nchance to train under a legendary chef...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1100_10": "Thank you for coming out, but I’m afraid there’s\nnothing I can do.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1200_10": "W-wait a sec! I came all this way...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1300_10": "Could we at least have a battle? You could do\nthat for me, couldn’t you? I’m not asking much!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1400_10": "Wow, you really won’t take no for an answer,\nwill you?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1500_10": "I just want to see if my skills are good enough to\nget the stamp of approval from a legendary chef!\nC’mon, pleeease?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1600_10": "Hmm...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1700_10": "I sense you have a very frank, forthright passion\nfor your craft... It would be wrong of me to\nsimply turn you away.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1800_10": "I accept. What sort of battle do you propose?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_1900_10": "I want a Pokémon battle and a cooking battle...\nEr...cook-off? Yeah, a cook-off! And I’m gonna\ngo all out for both!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2000_10": "All right. If you want to prove yourself that\nbadly, then Rosa and I have no choice but to\naccept your challenge with utmost hospitality.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2100_10": "In fact, I had a few uniforms imported to Pasio\nin case a situation like this were to arise!\nRosa, could you fetch them for me, please?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2200_10": "Let’s put them on and give Mallow here the\nfull-service Pokémon battle she deserves!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2300_10": "R-right away, Chef!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2400_10": "All right. I’m ready when you are!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4005_1001_2500_10": "Time to serve up a Super Mallow Special!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0100_10": "Wow, this uniform’s a little...flashier than\nI expected.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0200_10": "And where’d this Delibird come from?",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0300_10": "Huh. It must be a stowaway from the parcel our\nuniforms were sent in. I’m not sure how it got\nhere...but it may be just what we need.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0400_10": "Hospitality is the most important quality of any\ngood chef, and if there’s any Pokémon that knows\nthe true meaning of hospitality, it’s Delibird.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0500_10": "If you spend some quality time with Delibird,\nits kind, charitable nature may rub off on you.\nIt can help you grow as a chef!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0501_10": "Octillery has opened my eyes to a whole new\nrealm of culinary possibility since we first met...\nPerhaps it will be the same for you.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0600_10": "The true meaning of hospitality, huh...\nAll right! Delibird and I are gonna be\nbest friends in no time!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0700_10": "Let’s do our best, partner!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0800_10": "Phew! You really crushed it in that battle back\nthere. If your team were a meal, it would be\na pretty tasty one!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_0900_10": "Speaking of which, can we move on to our next\nbattle now? Er—I mean cook-off! I’ll go prepare\nmy dish first!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1000_10": "So? What do you think of my dish?! I call it the\nspecial Z-Set! Olivia and Hau are huge fans of it\nback in Alola.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1100_10": "I, uh... Um... It’s a little...different than what I\nwas expecting.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1200_10": "Y-you don’t say... I can tell Mallow really put\nher heart into it. What else is there to say\nexcept...mmmm!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1300_10": "Yes. It’s certainly an acquired taste...\nI taste intense creativity—a flavor that\nimmediately gets my brain buzzing.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1400_10": "*gasp*\nGoodness gracious! I just thought of a new recipe!\nI need to begin prepping right away.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1500_10": "No, wait! I lack the ingredients to fully execute\nit right now. First, I’ll have to gather everything\nI need.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1600_10": "Are you gonna go shopping for ingredients now?\nThat sounds like it could take a while.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1700_10": "Why don’t I cook up another dish in the meantime?\nIt’d be my pleasure!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1800_10": "What? Oh, no... You’re too kind.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_1900_10": "Uhhh... I’m gonna go help Siebold with the\nshopping! I am his assistant chef, after all.\nSee you later!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_2000_10": "W-wait! I can help you, too!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_2100_10": "Would you mind staying back to help Mallow,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]? We’ll be right back!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_2200_10": "C’mon, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nLet’s get cooking! I’m feeling a\nSuper Mallow Special coming on!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4007_1001_2300_10": "We’ll leave you two to it, then! Thanks!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_0100_10": "Phew! That cook-off definitely took a turn\nI wasn’t expecting...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_0200_10": "That battle was really something else, though!\nI feel like it sparked a new passion for cooking\nin me!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_0300_10": "I’m gonna keep working hard and learn whatever\nI can from Siebold. This party’s gonna rock your\nsocks off. I promise!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_0400_10": "But before that...",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_0500_10": "Here! I’ve got a little surprise for you as thanks\nfor helping me out today!",

    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_0401_0800_10": "Tee-hee! You’re welcome!\nI was afraid you wouldn’t like it.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_0302_0900_10": "You shouldn’t have!",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_0402_1000_10": "Tee-hee! I’ve been keeping it a secret.",
    "episode_event_christmas_2019/4008_1001_1100_10": "It’s thanks to you that I was able to become\nSiebold’s assistant chef and sync up with such\nan adorable new partner.",
