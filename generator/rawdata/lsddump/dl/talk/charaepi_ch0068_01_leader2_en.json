    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_0900_10": "We’ve been making sure that the Trainers and\nPokémon get proper rest between battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_1000_10": "The young master sure takes after his parents.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_1100_10": "He’s strict on himself, just like his father.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_1200_10": "And the way he takes care of his Pokémon and\nroyal subjects is just like his mother. ",

    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_0402_2000_10": "Well, because the queen saved him.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_2100_10": "Back when he was still a Murkrow, he snuck into\nthe royal treasure room.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_2200_10": "By the time I caught him, he’d scratched up some\nof the queen’s precious jewels.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_2300_10": "A lot of people thought he deserved to be\npunished for what he did.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_2400_10": "But the queen showed mercy and spared him that.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_2500_10": "I think ever since, he’s tried to return her kindness\nby keeping an eye on the kingdom and the\nroyal family.",

    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_0401_2700_10": "Yes, but I guess that really should be my job.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_0302_2800_10": "He’s a hard worker.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_0402_2900_10": "Yes, but I guess that really should be my job.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3000_10": "We’ve had our differences in the past, but we\neventually warmed up to each other.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3100_10": "Now, we’re the best of partners!",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3200_10": "I see... So Lear’s mother helped to bring you\ntwo together.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3300_10": "But that behavior is a bit unusual.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3400_10": "In most cases, Honchkrow make their cronies take\ncare of work like that... But yours is very\nproactive and does it by itself.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3500_10": "I think that shows just how grateful he felt\ntoward her.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3600_10": "That’s also why it came as such a shock when the\nqueen passed away...",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3700_10": "I know Honchkrow doesn’t understand human\nspeech, but that day, I think he understood what\nhappened because I was crying so much.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3800_10": "So his gratitude was so strong that it overcame his\nnatural instinct. For the queen’s sake, he protects\nthe kingdom.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_3900_10": "Guess so. The queen also did so much for me, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4000_10": "She’s the one who appointed me to be the young\nmaster’s personal bodyguard.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4100_10": "Being by the young master’s side and watching\nhim grow up taught me so much.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4200_10": "I just wish...",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4300_10": "I wish she could’ve seen how much he’s grown...",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4400_10": "S-Sawyer?!",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4500_10": "I’m sorry... What a mess.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4600_10": "The queen is no longer with us...but I try to be\nextra vigilant when it comes to the young master.\nFor her sake.",
    "charaepi_ch0068_01_leader2/2301_1201_4700_10": "Honchkrow and I won’t let her down!"
