    "ch0125_00_guzma/0101_0701_02_10": "Let’s get wild today and beat down some\nTrainers and send them flying!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0601_0701_01_10": "Destroy it all! Destroy it all and beat them down\nas much as you like! That’s what Team Skull’s\nall about!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0601_0701_02_10": "I live for beating down all those moldy, old\ntraditions and customs we’ve got in Alola. ",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0601_0701_03_10": "Here on Pasio, I’m gonna find a whole new kind\nof style! Yeah.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0601_0702_01_10": "Traditions? Old customs? That stuff’s not gonna\nhelp us.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0601_0702_02_10": "It’s better to embrace what the winds of change\nbring us.",

    "ch0125_00_guzma/0602_0701_03_10": "We’ll probably end up seeing her sooner or later.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0602_0702_01_10": "She and I have totally different styles when it\ncomes to thinking and battling.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0602_0702_02_10": "If I’m honest, I can never tell what she’s thinking.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0602_0702_03_10": "Maybe that’s why we get along so well.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0603_0701_01_10": "These fancy Pokémon Center cafés sure have a\nlot, but they’re still missing some important stuff!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0603_0701_02_10": "They don’t have my favorite drink from back\nin Alola!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0603_0701_03_10": "Here on Pasio, it’s got me thinking about that taste\nsometimes. Yeah.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0603_0702_01_10": "That drink is everywhere in Alola.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0603_0702_02_10": "If you find it around here, buy one for your boy\nGuzma, OK?",

    "ch0125_00_guzma/0604_0701_02_10": "Totally different from the way you think and live.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0604_0701_03_10": "But I think you’d actually fit in pretty well.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0604_0702_01_10": "I’m not only about destroying, you know.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0604_0702_02_10": "Team Skull is like a home for all of my crew, and\nI won’t ever let it be destroyed.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0701_01_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ]. You’ve got some\nreal great promise. Yeah. You’re different from\nthe others around here.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0701_02_10": "How about joining Team Skull and causing some\nhavoc with me?",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0701_03_10": "As a team, we could destroy anything we wanted.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0702_01_10": "When you join Team Skull, you gotta wear the\nteam’s mark.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0702_02_10": "We got shirts and masks, and some real\nsweet pendants.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/0605_0702_03_10": "Listen, I’m offering to set you up with an outfit\nI picked myself, so you better be thankful!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, take this.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/1701_0701_02_10": "That’s a gift from big bad Guzma. You better\nuse it!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/1701_0702_01_10": "Don’t go destroying that, got it?",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0701_01_10": "Now’s the time for my vaunted partner to let\nloose and destroy everything!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0701_02_10": "That’s why we’ve both got to keep getting\nstronger and stronger. Yeah!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0701_03_10": "So we’re gonna train again today until we’re\ntotally beat!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0702_01_10": "You and your partner make a pretty good\nsync pair. Yeah. Really something, I’d say.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0702_02_10": "Together we could destroy it all and bring about\na new wind of change!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2501_0702_03_10": "We’ll break down the walls that hold us back, and\nwe’ll get stronger and stronger!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0701_01_10": "I’m the boss of Team Skull.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0701_02_10": "Team Skull’s made up of people who were told\nthey had no future. Yeah. That’s why I gotta fight\nhard to give them one.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0701_03_10": "In the end, the wall we gotta destroy is the one\nwe put around ourselves...",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0701_04_10": "Until then, Team Skull’s our home, and that’s cool.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0702_01_10": "We’ve also got a strange kid in Team Skull who’s\nless of a good-for-nothing.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/2511_0702_02_10": "Wonder what that guy’s up to right now.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3001_0701_01_10": "Yo... Lookin’ pretty groggy over there. If you\nneed somebody to slap you awake, I’d be happy\nto oblige!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3002_0701_01_10": "What? I’m just givin’ the turf a quick once-over...\nGuess it’s become a habit.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3003_0701_01_10": "Y’know, Pasio’s a sweet, little island. It’d be a\nshame if somebody smashed it to pieces...\nHeh heh, sounds like fun.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3004_0701_01_10": "Me ’n’ my Pokémon gotta keep training our bodies\neach day so punks like you can’t beat us down!",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3005_0701_01_10": "Whaddya skulkin’ around at night for, huh?\nIf we were in Alola, you’d already be gettin’ the\nevil eye from Team Skull.",
    "ch0125_00_guzma/3006_0701_01_10": "Ain’t it past your bedtime, kid?\nGet outta here—unless you want a beatdown."
