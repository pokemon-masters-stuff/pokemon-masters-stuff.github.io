    "ch0125_40_guzma/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m gonna go all out today and smash everything\nup like I always do!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7101_0701_01_10": "No matter what I’m wearing, I’ll never change!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7101_0701_02_10": "I’m gonna break and smash and beat them\nall down!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7102_0701_01_10": "With this armor on, beating down anyone is\na piece of cake!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7102_0701_02_10": "It might look like it’s hard to move around in all\nthis, but it’s not.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7102_0701_03_10": "And that’s not all. It’s so tough that it hardly gets\na scratch, no matter what hits it.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7102_0701_04_10": "Hehe... This armor is awesome!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7103_0701_01_10": "The other day, I saw Buzzwole and Golisopod\ntogether.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7103_0701_02_10": "Instead of attacking, they just flexed at each other!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7103_0701_03_10": "What’s up with that?!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7103_0701_04_10": "I guess it doesn’t matter as long as they’re\nhaving fun.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7104_0701_01_10": "When you’re protecting your allies, digging in and\nwaiting around for the enemy isn’t the only way to\ndo it, you know.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7104_0701_02_10": "The best defense is a good offense. You gotta\nattack and attack and never let up!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7104_0701_03_10": "That way, they won’t even have a chance to\nattack you back! Now that’s what I call a strategy!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nWhen I’m with you, I feel like I could smash up\nthe whole world!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7105_0701_02_10": "Whaddya say? Wanna come with me and break\nsome things?",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/7105_0701_03_10": "When we go, I’ll even get you your own set\nof matching armor!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, take this. You’d better thank me for it!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/1701_0702_01_10": "Oh, and don’t even think about going wild and\nsmashing it, either!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0701_01_10": "Hey there, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nI was just thinking about why Buzzwole does\nthose body-building poses.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0701_02_10": "What do you think about it?",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0701_03_10": "I’ve been thinking about it for hours, and it doesn’t\nmake any sense! I don’t get it!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0701_04_10": "I guess it’s just something that only Buzzwole\ncan understand.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0702_01_10": "Wh-what?!\nYou’re still here?!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0702_02_10": "You listen here. I was NOT imitating Buzzwole’s\nbody-building poses, OK?",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2501_0702_03_10": "Now scram, kid!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0701_01_10": "You know that people call Buzzwole an\n“Ultra Beast” and they get all scared of it, right?",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0701_02_10": "Ugh. When I hear people say they think Buzzwole\nis scary just because of how it looks, it really\nbums me out.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0701_03_10": "Buzzwole hasn’t even done anything wrong...\nAt least not here on Pasio, anyway!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0702_01_10": "People judged me all the time on Alola even\nthough they didn’t know me.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0702_02_10": "Now that I’m here on Pasio, though, I’ve left that\nall behind and I’m just livin’ it up.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/2511_0702_03_10": "That’s why I tell Buzzwole to ignore the haters and\njust enjoy the battles here on Pasio.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/3001_0701_01_10": "What? I’m just givin’ the turf a quick once-over...\nGuess it’s become a habit.",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/3003_0701_01_10": "Me ’n’ my Pokémon gotta keep training our bodies\neach day so punks like you can’t beat us down!",
    "ch0125_40_guzma/3005_0701_01_10": "Ain’t it past your bedtime, kid?\nGet outta here—unless you want a beatdown."
