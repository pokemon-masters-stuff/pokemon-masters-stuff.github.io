    "ch0160_00_suiren/0101_0701_01_10": "Oh! Hello there, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m glad I got to see you today. You and your\npartner are always so full of energy! ",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0601_0701_01_10": "Doesn’t the sight of a nice coastline just make you\nwant to go fishing?",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0601_0701_02_10": "Though I suppose we can’t fish for wild Pokémon\nhere on Pasio.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0601_0701_03_10": "It’s such a pity.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0601_0701_04_10": "Maybe I should try reeling in a strapping young\nswimmer instead.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0602_0701_01_10": "My little sisters, Harper and Sarah, are such\nrascals that it’s hard to keep an eye on them.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0602_0701_02_10": "Sometimes they force Trainers who visit our house\nto battle them...",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0602_0701_03_10": "But you know, they’re pretty strong even though\nthey’re still young!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0602_0701_04_10": "I think they’re competing to see who’ll take on the\nrole of captain after me.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0603_0701_01_10": "I’m the captain of Brooklet Hill in Alola.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0603_0701_02_10": "It’s a wonderful spot full of Pokémon that love\nthe water!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0603_0701_03_10": "And if you go further in, you might even get to\nsee the Legendary Pokémon Kyogre.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0603_0701_04_10": "Just kidding! You took the bait, didn’t you!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0604_0701_01_10": "There are lots of Pokémon that love the rain.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0604_0701_02_10": "I also feel like I can focus better while fishing if\nI’m listening to the rain!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0604_0701_03_10": "Watching all the ripples form on the surface of\nthe water while you sit and wait for a bite... It’s\nnothing like fishing on a sunny day!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0604_0701_04_10": "Ah, just talking about it makes me want to go\nfishing again!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0605_0701_01_10": "You just keep getting stronger,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0605_0701_02_10": "In light of that, I’ve prepared a little trial for you\nas a captain!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0605_0701_03_10": "Would you...come with me to try some of\nMallow’s cooking?",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/0605_0701_04_10": "She said she’s going to prepare a full course with\nfresh-picked Berries! It should be delicious. At\nleast, I hope it is.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/1701_0701_01_10": "Thanks for always helping me out! I have a\npresent for you!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/1701_0702_01_10": "Actually, it’s something I fished up from the ocean\nhere on Pasio.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/1701_0702_02_10": "I knew when I reeled it in that I wanted you to\nhave it, so I saved it just for you!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0701_01_10": "Did you know that there are different types of\nfishing rods?",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0701_02_10": "For example, you probably won’t be able to catch\nanything big with just any old rod.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0701_03_10": "But the fishing rods I make are high-quality.\nAs long as you’re using one of those, you’re in\ngood hands!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0701_04_10": "If you ever clear my trial at Brooklet Hill, I’ll gladly\ngive you one!\n",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0702_01_10": "Actually, I just wanted you to have an excuse to\ncome visit me in Alola...",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2501_0702_02_10": "Plus, there are lots of great places in Alola—not\njust Brooklet Hill!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0701_01_10": "The ocean is great for fishing, and it’s also the\nperfect place to swim!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0701_02_10": "Nothing beats the feeling of floating with the\nwaves surrounded by Water-type Pokémon!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0701_03_10": "Sometimes, wild Pokémon play annoying little\ntricks on me...",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0701_04_10": "But I make sure to get back at them with\nmy Z-Power!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0702_01_10": "Pasio’s beaches are beautiful, and they don’t have\nany mischievous Pokémon playing tricks on people,\nso they’re the perfect place to hang out!",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/2511_0702_02_10": "I even promised Mallow that we’d go shopping\ntogether for some cute swimsuits.",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/3001_0701_01_10": "You sure are a busy one, aren’t you. You didn’t\neven take time to fix your bedhead this morning!\n",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/3003_0701_01_10": "What a great day it is today! We should go\nswimming with our Pokémon!\n",
    "ch0160_00_suiren/3005_0701_01_10": "Chinchou and Lanturn’s lights shine beautifully in\nthe night sea of Alola. "
