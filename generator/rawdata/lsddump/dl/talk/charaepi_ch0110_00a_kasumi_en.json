    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_0400_10": "*chuckle* True. It was close up until the very end.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_0500_10": "Too close! How about we battle again and see\nwho wins this time!",

    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_1300_10": "Don’t you think it’s time for a break?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_1400_10": "No way! We’re totally fine. Let’s keep the\nbattles rolling!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_0301_1500_10": "It’s important to take breaks.",

    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_1900_10": "*sigh* All right, all right... Let’s take a break.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2000_10": "I think that’s for the best. What’s got you in such\na hurry today anyway?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2100_10": "You may have noticed during our battle, but my\nPsyduck reeeally loves to loaf around.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2200_10": "When we traveled around Kanto together, he was\nalways waddling at the back of the group.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2300_10": "And you’re hoping a bit of extra training might\nhelp him grow out of it?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2400_10": "That’s the theory! Plus, he always tries his\nvery best...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2500_10": "What kind of Trainer would I be if let him down\nwhen he’s trying so hard? I couldn’t do that!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2600_10": "I want us to keep getting stronger together, and\nmaybe one day I’ll get to see him waddle right\npast the rest of the group!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2700_10": "That’s so like you, Misty. Always wanting to take\ncare of others.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2800_10": "Oh? Do you think Psyduck knows we’re talking\nabout him?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_2900_10": "Probably. I’m pretty sure he understands us for\nthe most part.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3000_10": "So he likes to do things at his own pace, but he’s\nactually a really hard worker... Maybe that noggin\nof his is burning with energy we just can’t see!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3100_10": "Maybe! What’s on the inside doesn’t have to match\nthe outside. You know, that kinda reminds me of\nyou in a way.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3200_10": "Um, what?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3300_10": "You usually look so cool and composed, but once\nyou’re focused on a battle, it’s like nothing else\nexists, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3400_10": "You’re...not wrong about that.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3500_10": "See? You and Psyduck are more alike than\nyou think.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3600_10": "I think you might be right... And now all I can\nthink about is helping Psyduck live his best life!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_3700_10": "I want to be there when he finally waddles past\nthe rest of the group!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_0301_3800_10": "Me too!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_0401_3900_10": "Do you want to train with us, too,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_0302_4000_10": "Let’s do some training!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_0402_4100_10": "A second ago, you said we should take a break,\nand now you want to help Psyduck train?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_4200_10": "All right! Why don’t the three of us have a\nbattle, then?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_4300_10": "Don’t underestimate us, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_4400_10": "Psyduck may still be in training, but he’s got a\nwhole lot of power hiding under that cute face!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00a_kasumi/2301_1201_4500_10": "Ready for a taste of his true strength?"
