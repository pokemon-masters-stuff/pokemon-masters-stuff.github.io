    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0401_0500_10": "By having Pokémon battles at the ingredient shops!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0302_0600_10": "Collect? We aren’t buying them?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0402_0700_10": "When we find ingredients we want, we have to\nchallenge that store to a Pokémon battle!",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_1000_10": "Right! So all we have to do to get ingredients is\nwin battles!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0301_1100_10": "Sounds good! I’m ready to battle!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0401_1200_10": "That’s the spirit! With you and Dawn here, getting\nall the ingredients we need will be a piece\nof cake!",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_1500_10": "All right! Before we battle, let’s check what\ningredients we need.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_1600_10": "We’re going to make Poké Puffs. They’re a\npopular treat in Kalos.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_1700_10": "As far as ingredients go, we’ll need frosting,\nchocolate, and Berries.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_2400_10": "Oh, hello, Serena and Dawn.\nAh, [Name:PlayerNickname ] is here, too, I see.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_2600_10": "Yes, but we can stop to help out if there’s\nsomething you need help with!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_2700_10": "Well, the truth is...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_2800_10": "I see. So there’s someone you want to show your\nthanks to, but you’re not very good at\nmaking sweets?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_2900_10": "I tried a few times, but I could never quite get\nit right.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_3200_10": "But she said that she still wasn’t confident in her\nability with just the recipe alone, so...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_3300_10": "I see. In that case, why don’t you two come make\nsweets with us?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_3400_10": "I know how it feels to have someone special who\nyou want to show thanks to.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_3500_10": "What do you two think of that plan?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0301_3600_10": "The more the merrier!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0401_3700_10": "I don’t mind, either. Let’s make some tasty\nsweets together!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0302_3800_10": "It sounds like fun!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_0402_3900_10": "It sure does. Let’s all have fun making some tasty\nsweets together!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_4000_10": "Th-thank you! I’ll do my best!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4001_1001_4100_10": "All right! Let’s get to collecting ingredients!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_1001_0100_10": "I think we’ve got the ingredients we need. Now\nwe just need somewhere to make the sweets.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_1001_0200_10": "Oh, hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Are you\ngetting ready for Palentine’s Day?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_0301_0300_10": "Yeah. You, too?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_0401_0400_10": "Yes! I’m about to head to Professor Bellis’s lab to\nmake some sweets!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_0302_0500_10": "You’re collecting ingredients, too?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_0402_0600_10": "I actually already got all I need. I’m about to head\nto Professor Bellis’s lab to make some sweets!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_1001_0700_10": "Mina, Professor Bellis, and I are planning to make\nthem together!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_1001_0800_10": "That sounds great! Would you mind if we\ntagged along?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4002_1001_0900_10": "I don’t mind! And I bet Professor Bellis will be\nhappy to see you, too!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0100_10": "Professor Bellis! I found a few reliable friends to\nhelp us make sweets!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0200_10": "Subarashii! How wonderful! Welcome, welcome!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0300_10": "Sorry for showing up without notice. Would it be\nOK for us to make sweets with you?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0400_10": "Mais bien sûr! But of course! Palentine’s Day is a\nday to enjoy together with friends!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0500_10": "I have everything you would ever need to make\nsweets here. Have at it!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0600_10": "Thank you! In that case, let’s get right to it!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0700_10": "This oven has such fine controls! It’s so easy\nto use!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0800_10": "And this mixer can be set to the exact mixing\nstrength you want!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_0900_10": "Professor Bellis told me that she actually specially\nmade all of these tools herself!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1000_10": "With all these tools, we’ll be able to make way\nbetter sweets than we’d planned on!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1100_10": "What could have made it explode?!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1200_10": "Are you two OK? You aren’t hurt, are you?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1300_10": "We’re fine, but our sweets...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1400_10": "I’m not sure what could have caused an explosion,\nbut why not try reducing the amount of\ningredients you use?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1500_10": "Hmm... Maybe check the heat you’re using, too?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1600_10": "Oh, Whimsicott! Would you bring us some new\ningredients, please?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1700_10": "Would you like to try mixing with me?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1800_10": "Alcremie, get ready with the frosting for when\nthey’re done baking!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_1900_10": "Don’t worry about breaking any of my tools. I can\nalways fix them! Just think of this as\nan eksperimenteer!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2000_10": "We’ll help, too!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2100_10": "Why can’t I ever get it right?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2200_10": "No matter how many times I try, I always fail! I’ve\ntried everything! I give up!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_0301_2300_10": "We have to go after her!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_0401_2400_10": "Yes, we do! I want to make sure she makes it to\nthe end of this baking adventure with us!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_0302_2500_10": "There are still things she can try!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_0402_2600_10": "You’re right! We still have time. I’m sure she’ll\nfigure it out!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2700_10": "I’ll clean up here. You all run along and find\nyour friend!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2800_10": "What? These sweets...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4003_1001_2900_10": "Hey, would you mind if I join you to look for that\ngirl who just ran off?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0100_10": "Look! Over there!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0200_10": "I’m glad we found you. We got worried when you\njust suddenly ran off.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0300_10": "Let’s all go back to Professor Bellis’s lab\ntogether, OK?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0400_10": "I don’t want to go back. I don’t think I’ll ever get\nit right...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0500_10": "But you were trying so hard. Do you really want\nto give up?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0600_10": "I can’t keep on trying! I don’t want to fail again!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0700_10": "It’s OK to make mistakes!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0800_10": "The important thing on Palentine’s Day is the heart\nthat you put into your gift!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_0900_10": "You worked so hard to collect ingredients and\nwere doing your best at making the sweets.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1000_10": "You’ve already put a lot of heart into it!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1100_10": "I agree with Dawn.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1200_10": "You looked like you were having fun when we\nwere cooking, no matter how many times you\nmessed up.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1300_10": "You had such a great smile that I forgot what I\nwas doing and started sketching you instead\nof cooking!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1400_10": "Well, you’re right. I was having fun cooking...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3900_10": "I even imagined the looks of happiness on the\nfaces of the people receiving the sweets.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1500_10": "But just because it’s fun doesn’t mean I can do it\nwell, and there’s no point if I can’t do it well!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1600_10": "I believe in you! These sweets of yours show just\nhow much heart you have!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1700_10": "Two? You were trying to make two\ndifferent sweets?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1800_10": "Were you maybe trying to make enough for your\npartner Pokémon as well?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_1900_10": "Well, I think that explains why the ingredients\ndidn’t work together!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2000_10": "In that case, why don’t we increase the amounts\nof the ingredients you’re using and tweak the\nrecipe a bit as well?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2100_10": "Just increasing the ingredient amounts may\nnot be enough. We might need to cook them\ndifferently, too...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2200_10": "Oh! I have an idea!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2300_10": "In Alola, we sometimes just share a single big\nmalasada with our Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2400_10": "That’s a great idea! Instead of making two smaller\nones, we can just make a single big one!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2500_10": "That might be just the idea to make this work!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2600_10": "But...but what if I fail again?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2700_10": "You can do it! I believe in you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2800_10": "You’ve worked hard and overcome all sorts of\nobstacles in the past!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_2900_10": "What? Why are you here?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3000_10": "It looked like something was bothering you, so I\ngot worried and decided to sort of keep an eye\non you...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3100_10": "I’m sorry for following you around without telling\nyou, but I just can’t bear to see you like this!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3200_10": "You actually regret running away like that, don’t\nyou. Are you sure you want to give up now?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3300_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3400_10": "I don’t think I understand...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3500_10": "I think they want to say that they were having fun\nmaking sweets with you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3600_10": "I was having fun, too. I sure would like to make\nsweets with you again!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3700_10": "Thank you...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4004_1001_3800_10": "OK! I’ll try it one more time!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0100_10": "We did it!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0200_10": "Wow! That looks really good!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0300_10": "It’s cooked just right, and you’ve decorated it\nperfectly as well!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0400_10": "That’s amazing! You can add this to the list of\nobstacles you’ve overcome!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0500_10": "Thank you. It’s all thanks to all of you.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0600_10": "Um...so...anyway...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0700_10": "Here! This is for you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0800_10": "What?! For me?!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_0900_10": "I wanted to thank you for always being there to\ncheer me on. Thank you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_1000_10": "I’m thankful for you, too! Thank you for always\nbeing by my side!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_1100_10": "And thank you for being here today to cheer me\non! Here, let’s split this!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_1200_10": "I’m glad everything worked out in the end!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_1300_10": "Me too! All right, now it’s our turn to do our best!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4005_1001_1400_10": "Let’s show everyone just how thankful we are\nfor them!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0100_10": "I’m so glad you came!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0200_10": "Hehe. This is kind of embarrassing, but...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0300_10": "Well, you see...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0400_10": "the reason I called you out here today is because\nI had something I just had to give you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0500_10": "Here it is! Palentine’s Day sweets from me to you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0700_10": "I made another one later after we all made our\nsweets together.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0800_10": "It’s tasty. I guarantee it! Actually, it may be the\ntastiest thing I made today!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_1001_0900_10": "I worked really hard on it. I hope you’ll accept it.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_0301_1000_10": "Of course!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_0401_1100_10": "Hehe. Thanks!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_0302_1200_10": "Thank you!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4006_0402_1300_10": "No, thank YOU!",

    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4007_1001_0400_10": "Here it is... It’s a Palentine’s Day sweet!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2021/4007_1001_0600_10": "I made it by myself, and I think I burnt it a little.\nBut don’t worry—I’m sure it still tastes good!",
