    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0701_04_10": "Oh!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0701_05_10": "Oops! Sorry, I kinda zoned out there.\nSometimes I just get lost in my thoughts.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0701_06_10": "Being able to focus and concentrate\nhelps a lot with painting, too.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0701_07_10": "Painting is pretty much my life.\nI’ve loved doing art forever.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0701_08_10": "It’s one of the reasons I came to Pasio,\nactually. I wanted to see all of the beauty\nthis place has to offer.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0702_01_10": "Whenever I paint or sketch people,\nI feel like I somehow get to know\nthem better.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0601_0702_02_10": "I wanna get to know everything about\nyou, your Pokémon, and Pasio, too!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0602_0701_01_10": "Back in Alola, we have this Pokémon\ncalled Shiinotic.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0602_0701_02_10": "The way they move their little bodies around\nis really unique—I make them the subject\nof a lot of my paintings.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0602_0701_03_10": "Although, if you stare at them long\nenough, you’ll start to get sleepy.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0602_0702_01_10": "Anyway, if you ever come across a Shiinotic,\ntake good care of it! And be careful you\ndon’t end up dozing off.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0602_0702_02_10": "Shiinotic have kind of an odd look\nabout them, but I promise they’re all\nreally nice!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0701_01_10": "Oops. I think I got some paint on my face.\nGuess that’s proof I painted something rad!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0701_02_10": "When I get super focused on my work,\nsometimes the paint flies everywhere and\nI end up looking like a canvas myself!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0701_03_10": "I’m not kidding! When the paint’s flying\naround, that’s a good thing! It’s fun getting\ncovered in paint.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0701_04_10": "I mean, sometimes I put paint on myself\non purpose. Helps to get me in the mood.\nKinda like a good luck charm or something.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0702_01_10": "If you get paint on your face, do you look\nin the mirror before you wash it off?\nI’m always curious to see what I look like.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0603_0702_02_10": "I mean, getting paint on your face can be\nlike a piece of art on its own. You just\ngotta wash it off in the end.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0701_01_10": "My Granbull has a pretty scary-looking mug,\nbut underneath that, he’s really just a big\nscaredy-cat.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0701_02_10": "Once he warms up to you, he’ll snuggle and play\nall day, though. Such a cutie pie!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0701_03_10": "When Granbull was just a little Snubbull,\nhe sometimes used to gnaw on\nmy paintings.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0701_04_10": "It took me a while to figure it out, but he actually\ndid that when he was really happy.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0702_01_10": "I guess now I know my Granbull\nloves my paintings! Heh heh.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0604_0702_02_10": "I’ll have to keep painting more and more stuff\nif I want to keep him happy!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, do you think you could come and\nfind me after the PML’s over?",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0605_0701_02_10": "It’s just, like, I think you have a really\nbeautiful heart, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0605_0701_03_10": "It would make me really happy if I could\nsketch you and your Pokémon.\nIf I could capture your hearts in a painting.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0605_0702_01_10": "I wonder what color palette would best\nrepresent that pure heart of yours.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/0605_0702_02_10": "Heh heh, I guess that’s for me to know\nand you to find out! I’m excited to start.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/1701_0701_01_10": "Pasio’s chock-full of interesting stuff!\nI came across this a little while ago.",

    "ch0034_00_matsurika/1701_0702_01_10": "Don’t lose it, OK?",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/1701_0702_02_10": "I’m sure it’ll help you on your journey.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2501_0701_01_10": "Alola!\nWell, well, aren’t you a ray of\nsunshine today.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2501_0701_02_10": "Oh. That just gave me an idea for\na new painting. A nice, happy one.",

    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2501_0702_03_10": "I’ve got my friends Ilima, Mallow...\nOh! That reminds me, I need to go\nmeet up with Sophocles!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2501_0702_04_10": "Man, I love my friends.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0701_01_10": "Wha—?! Wait, stop right there!\nYou can’t come over here right now!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0701_02_10": "I’m finishing up a super, super\nimportant piece over here! Sorry!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0701_03_10": "Yeah, I know I’m always painting.\nBut this one’s really special, OK?!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0701_04_10": "I don’t wanna ruin the surprise!\nSo no peeking, OK?! I mean it!",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0702_01_10": "Hmm... The last finishing touches\nare super important, but I’m not sure\nwhere I wanna go with it yet...",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0702_02_10": "W-wait a sec! I thought I told you\nno peeking! Sheesh, all I want is to\nkeep my painting a secret.",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0702_03_10": "I wanna make sure I do us justice—\nme and Granbull, you and your Pokémon,\nour cute, smiley faces...",
    "ch0034_00_matsurika/2511_0702_04_10": "Wait! That was supposed to be a secret!\nYou didn’t hear any of that, OK?!",
