    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_0300_10": "Hm? Oh, it’s [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0301_0400_10": "What’re you up to?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0401_0500_10": "I was just on a walk with Reshiram to get to know\nit better.",

    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_1000_10": "It lent its power to twin heroes, but when the\nheroes had a falling out, it apparently split into\ntwo separate entities.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_1100_10": "It wanted to support both heroes, and that’s what\ncaused it to split... What an amazing feat of love.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_1200_10": "Just like the Reshiram and Zekrom of those\nlegends, I’d like to support both of them equally.",

    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0401_1400_10": "Well, we’re friends, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0302_1500_10": "What a great idea!",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0402_1600_10": "Well, we are friends, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_1700_10": "It’s also my way of repaying them.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_1800_10": "Reshiram stayed by my side during my\ndarkest moments...",

    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2000_10": "I want to learn all about Reshiram and deepen\nour love.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0301_2100_10": "Is it working?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0401_2200_10": "Yes, I believe so.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0302_2300_10": "That’s wonderful!",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0402_2400_10": "Thank you. I do think it’s working, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2500_10": "Lately, I feel more in sync with my Pokémon when\nwe battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2600_10": "I can tell what Reshiram is thinking, even without\nlistening to what it’s saying.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2700_10": "I suppose this is what a true connection is like.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2800_10": "Yes, I think so too, Reshiram.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_2900_10": "Would you mind having a battle with us, \n[Name:PlayerNickname ], for the sake of\ntrue love?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0301_3000_10": "True love?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0401_3100_10": "It’s what we pursue.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0302_3200_10": "Sure!",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0402_3300_10": "Thank you. This will bring us closer to what we’re\nsearching for.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3400_10": "I traveled with Zekrom, and when we met\nReshiram, we battled...",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3500_10": "But as we were battling, we felt a connection.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3600_10": "It made me think...if human conflict is what tears\nPokémon apart, maybe love from humans can help\nbring them together again.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3700_10": "That’s why I’d like to battle you. You seem to have\nthe strongest bonds with many sync pairs here.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3800_10": "By battling you, I might get closer to finding that\ntrue love I seek.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_3900_10": "If possible, I’d like you to help us on our quest to\nfind this love.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_4000_10": "Reshiram seems quite fond of you, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0301_4100_10": "Leave it to me!",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0401_4200_10": "I had a feeling you’d say that.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0302_4300_10": "I’m not sure how helpful I’ll be...",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_0402_4400_10": "I know you’ll do great. In fact, you’re the perfect\nperson on Pasio for this.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_4500_10": "OK, Reshiram! It’s time to battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0089_40_n/2301_1201_4600_10": "We’re going to forge the greatest love of all—one\nwhere our hearts are truly connected!"
