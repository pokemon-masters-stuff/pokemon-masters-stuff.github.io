    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1100_10": "It’s ours now! Hand it over!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1200_10": "Absolutely not. If you’re asking for a battle, a\nbattle is what you’ll get!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1300_10": "No matter what great forces stand before us, we\nshall fight with valor till the very end!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1400_10": "Heh. That so? Then I guess I just have to take it\nby force!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1500_10": "We crumble in defeat...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4005_1001_1600_10": "Bahaha! Sorry, dude, this golden sphere is ours\nnow! One down!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0100_10": "Take this!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0200_10": "Aw, man... They’re so strong!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0300_10": "Let’s retreat!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0400_10": "Phew... We did it!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0500_10": "Well played, m’lady!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0600_10": "Um...is it just me, or have we not moved much\nsince we left camp?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0700_10": "It’s not just you. We haven’t actually gone very\nfar at all.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0800_10": "I knew it...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_0900_10": "But that’s because that costume is limiting your\nmovement. It’s not your fault.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1000_10": "What should we do? At this rate, we won’t find\nany golden spheres!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1100_10": "Don’t sweat it. Let’s just take it slow and steady,\none step at a time.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1200_10": "No, I can’t take it easy! I want to support\nour team!",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1400_10": "Well, there is one way to do that... A way that\nuses your solid defensive moves to our advantage.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1500_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1600_10": "Well, hear me out...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1700_10": "I see!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1800_10": "Whaddya think? Pretty good strategy, right?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_1900_10": "I love it! Let’s give it a shot!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4006_1001_2000_10": "We’re heading into enemy territory!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4007_1001_0100_10": "We’ve got you cornered now. You won’t\nget away!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4007_1001_0200_10": "Are you sure you don’t want to surrender?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4007_1001_0300_10": "There’s no way you can beat us when it’s three of\nus versus just one of you! ",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4007_1001_0400_10": "This is bad!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1101_0100_10": "Rewind to before Hilda was cornered by\nErika and the others...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0200_10": "Awesome! We found a golden sphere! That was\neasier than I thought!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0300_10": "Yeah, we’re doing great!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0400_10": "At this rate, winning’ll be a cin—",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0500_10": "Hm?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0600_10": "What’s wrong?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0700_10": "I saw someone moving in the shadows just now.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0800_10": "Y-you mean someone from the other team\nis here?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_0900_10": "Yeah, I think so. But they’re not making a\nmove yet...probably because they don’t have\nenough backup to take us on.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1000_10": "Hmm... That gives me an idea.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1100_10": "N-no way! That’s risky!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1200_10": "I’m not sure if we’ll be able to buy you enough\ntime to do that...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1300_10": "If only we were as strong as you, Hilda.\nThat’d be a different story...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1400_10": "You’ll be fine! We fought together all the way\nhere, didn’t we?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1500_10": "I know you two can do it. Can I count on you?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1600_10": "Um...OK! If you say so, we’ll give it a try!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4008_1001_1700_10": "Yeah! Next time we see each other, it’ll be with\nsmiles on our faces, OK?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1101_0100_10": "And back to the present...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0200_10": "Ooof!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0300_10": "Oh, are you OK? I hope we didn’t overdo it.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0400_10": "Sorry that we’ve cornered you like this...but a\nbattle is a battle!",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0600_10": "Whoa, check it out!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0700_10": "Look! The Battle of the Golden Spheres is\nhappening right here in town!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_0800_10": "Oh dear. It seems we’ve drawn a crowd.",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1000_10": "Why are you laughing?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1100_10": "Running away was just part of our strategy! Time\nto turn these tables around!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1200_10": "Eeep!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1300_10": "Wh-what?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1400_10": "Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Highness!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1500_10": "Not at all! You arrived just in time!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1600_10": "Reinforcements! When did she have time to\ncontact them?",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1700_10": "I knew for a fact that I was being followed! So I\nlured you here...all while pretending to be alone!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1800_10": "My teammates bought me some time!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_1900_10": "Darn. So it was all a ruse!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2000_10": "Let’s go, Your Highness!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2100_10": "Yes, my valiant knight!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2200_10": "Oh dear... They really have turned the tables\non us!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2300_10": "I guess we have no choice but to surrender!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2400_10": "All right! Now we’ve got two golden spheres!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2500_10": "Wow! That was amazing!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2600_10": "What a fantastic battle!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2700_10": "I think the audience liked that! I’d say your efforts\nto captivate everyone with your battle have been\na huge success!",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_2900_10": "Well, I’m still nowhere near as good as you or\nLisia, though...",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4009_1001_3000_10": "Are you sure? Look, Keldeo is praising you for a\njob well done, too!",

    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_0500_10": "My bad! We weren’t careful enough.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_0600_10": "No worries. If they stole it from us, let’s just steal\nit right back!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_0700_10": "No sense cryin’ over it. Let’s go!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_0800_10": "Thank you! And sorry for the inconvenience, sir!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_0900_10": "Hmph. Even if they’ve taken our golden sphere,\nthey still have to take it all the way back to\ntheir camp.",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4010_1001_1000_10": "So all we gotta do is storm right into\ntheir territory!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4011_1001_0100_10": "Well, that was easier than I thought! We got a\ngolden sphere!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4011_1001_0200_10": "Oui! Let’s bring it back to camp immediately!",
    "episode_event_specialcos01_main/4011_1001_0300_10": "Yeah! Even though the other team tried to stop us,\nthey never stood a chance!",
