    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0701_01_10": "My older sister, Alexa, gave me my camera.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0701_02_10": "Alexa’s a journalist for a big publishing house!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0701_03_10": "My dream is to use this camera to take all kinds\nof pictures of different Pokémon!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0701_04_10": "Of course I’m taking pictures on Pasio, too.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0701_05_10": "I feel like Pasio’s got a lot of passion!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0702_01_10": "By the way, I’m a Gym Leader. At the\nSantalune City Gym, you can see my\nPokémon pictures on display.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0601_0702_02_10": "I’m trying to get the word out about it here on\nPasio, too. I hope people will come to see it.",

    "ch0039_00_viola/0602_0702_01_10": "If you ever meet a wild Surskit, be sure to watch\nit closely!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0602_0702_02_10": "Its tiny legs support its whole body on the\nwater. How can you not love it?",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0701_01_10": "I take pictures of things other than\nPokémon, too!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0701_02_10": "Pokémon Trainers, of course. But also the scenery\nin towns and natural settings!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0701_03_10": "When I’m shooting Pokémon, of course Bug-type\nPokémon are my favorites! They’re just so cute!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0701_04_10": "The Evolution of Bug-type Pokémon is a lot\nfaster and more mysterious than other Pokémon!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0702_01_10": "I’ll never get tired of taking pictures of\nPokémon, no matter how many I take.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0603_0702_02_10": "Focusing on something I love and clicking\nthe shutter is the best feeling in the world!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0701_01_10": "There’s a Pokémon from the Kalos region called\nVivillon. It’s a fantastic Pokémon!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0701_02_10": "Even though they’re the same species, many\nVivillon have different wing patterns!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0701_03_10": "That’s why there are lots of people around the\nworld who collect different Vivillon!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0701_04_10": "I’m one of those people! Even here on Pasio, \nI plan to look for people with rare Vivillon!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0702_01_10": "I want to make an album with photos of every\nkind of Vivillon someday!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0604_0702_02_10": "You’ll help me with that, right? I’m really\nlooking forward to it!",

    "ch0039_00_viola/0605_0702_01_10": "But not just as a model, of course. I really enjoy\nPokémon battles together with you, too!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/0605_0702_02_10": "Let’s keep on doing our best,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",

    "ch0039_00_viola/1701_0701_02_10": "Here’s a present to celebrate your strength!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/1701_0702_01_10": "There are things you can only see \nthrough a viewfinder!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/1701_0702_02_10": "If I find anything again, I’ll be sure to give\nit to you!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0701_01_10": "Oh! Look at that Pokémon’s nimble walk! \nWhat a photo op!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0701_02_10": "Wha—?! It ran off.\nI must’ve gotten too close.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0701_03_10": "The trick to taking Pokémon pictures is to not\nalert them to your presence.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0701_04_10": "Making sure you don’t startle or alert the\nPokémon—that’s gotta be the first step, right?",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0702_01_10": "Take your lens and focus it...focus it...\nThen snap that shot!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0702_02_10": "Practice helps you get better at taking pictures. \nIt’s the same for catching Pokémon, right?",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0702_03_10": "You need to aim your throw with the Poké Ball.\nThen throw it at the exact right time!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2501_0702_04_10": "Timing is important to both. Poké Balls and film\nare limited, after all.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0701_01_10": "Ah, wait! I should take a picture here! \nYou’ve got a great smile going on!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0701_02_10": "Hm? Why am I so into taking photos? Hmm.\nI guess it’s because of my older sister.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0701_03_10": "Alexa, writer for the Lumiose Press! That’s\nmy supercool older sister.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0701_04_10": "My older sister knows I love pictures, so\nshe gave me this wonderful camera!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0702_01_10": "Why do I take pictures of smiling faces?\nThat should be obvious!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0702_02_10": "Because they’re just fabulous! That’s how I feel\nabout smiling faces!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0702_03_10": "Taking pictures and having pictures taken\nmakes people happier and happier. It’s the best!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/2511_0702_04_10": "Taking joyful pictures is the whole reason I’m\na photographer!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning!\nLet’s make sure today’s fantastic!",
    "ch0039_00_viola/3002_0701_01_10": "I bet I’ll find a lot of photo ops today, too!",

    "ch0039_00_viola/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening!\nNighttime photography can be tricky,\nbut you can snag some fantastic photos.",
    "ch0039_00_viola/3006_0701_01_10": "You worked hard today! Get some good rest so\nwe can take another shot tomorrow!"
