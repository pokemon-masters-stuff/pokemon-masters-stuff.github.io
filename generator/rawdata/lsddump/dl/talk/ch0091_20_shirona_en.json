    "ch0091_20_shirona/0101_0701_02_10": "Care to join me on a little excursion around\nthe island?",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7101_0701_01_10": "In myths, there are many accounts of Pokémon\ninteracting with the rest of the world.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7101_0701_02_10": "Thus, learning about these myths allows you to\nlearn more about different facets of world history.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7101_0701_03_10": "If you’re interested in that, I’d be happy to explain\nmore about it.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7102_0701_01_10": "Giratina lives in a world that exists on the\nreverse side of ours.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7102_0701_02_10": "It’s a mysterious world, one that’s both near and\nfar from ours at the same time.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7102_0701_03_10": "For us, it’s unreachable...but also closer than we\nmay think.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7102_0701_04_10": "Quite poetic, isn’t it?",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7103_0701_01_10": "This outfit’s design is based on Giratina.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7103_0701_02_10": "And just like Giratina, who watches over us from\nthe world on the other side of ours...",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7103_0701_03_10": "I hope to look deeper into the other sides of the\nmyths I research as well.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7104_0701_01_10": "It’s difficult to decipher a clear message from\na wall mural in the same way you do when\nreading written text.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7104_0701_02_10": "But these murals have a strong impact on those\nwho see them, and they evoke thoughts and\nfeelings in a way words can’t express.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7105_0701_01_10": "When I see that sparkle in your eyes, it reminds\nme of a Trainer I know.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/7105_0701_02_10": "That Trainer and I met Giratina together. I still\nremember it vividly to this day.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh! There you are!",

    "ch0091_20_shirona/2501_0701_01_10": "Have you ever thought that it’d be nice to\nmeet a character from a story in real life?",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2501_0701_02_10": "I’ve always dreamed of meeting the Pokémon\ndepicted in Sinnoh’s myths.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2501_0701_03_10": "And now I’ve become a sync pair with Giratina.\nI never imagined it would actually happen.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2501_0702_01_10": "As long as you keep on dreaming, eventually,\nwishes do come true.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2501_0702_02_10": "That applies to you, too. You should pursue and\nfocus on the things you love.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2511_0701_01_10": "There are Trainers who harbor so much hate for\nthis world that they’re plotting to recreate it.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2511_0701_02_10": "But they’re wrong.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2511_0701_03_10": "The history of our world was built by everyone\nworking together, hand in hand.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2511_0702_01_10": "When you meet wonderful people and Pokémon,\nI think your heart also changes for the better.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/2511_0702_02_10": "If everyone’s heart starts to change for the better,\nI believe the world will become a better\nplace, too.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/3001_0701_01_10": "The sunrise before a big journey, the dawn of\na new adventure... Mornings can rouse all sorts\nof emotions within us.",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/3003_0701_01_10": "Did you know that the ruins they created on Pasio\nare based on real ruins found in other regions?",
    "ch0091_20_shirona/3005_0701_01_10": "I can tell by the look on your face that you and\nyour partner conquered another hurdle today,\ndidn’t you."
