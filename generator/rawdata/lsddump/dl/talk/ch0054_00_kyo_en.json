    "ch0054_00_kyo/0101_0701_02_10": "Fwahaha! Let us not waste a single day that\ncould be used to hone our skills!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0701_01_10": "I was originally a Gym Leader, and \nI made an invisible labyrinth in my Gym.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0701_02_10": "Of course, it was to weed out weak Trainers!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0701_03_10": "But my daughter got lost in there once and\ncreated quite a scene.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0701_04_10": "She has since grown to be my successor and a\nfine ninja as well as a Gym Leader, but...",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0701_05_10": "No matter how old she may become, she is still\nmy child. That story will always bring a smile\nto my face.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0702_01_10": "My daughter looks up to me. Maybe it’s because\nof this that she is showing very fast growth!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0601_0702_02_10": "I must train twice as hard to make sure that I am\nnot overtaken by the girl.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0701_01_10": "We have a large park in Fuchsia City called the\nSafari Zone.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0701_02_10": "It is a place where you can observe Pokémon\nin their natural habitat.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0701_03_10": "If you ever go to the Kanto region, go see\nfor yourself! I am certain you’d discover\nsomething new.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0702_01_10": "I also patrol the Safari Zone myself.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0702_02_10": "Fwahaha! It is in order for all visiting guests\nto enjoy the park safely!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0602_0702_03_10": "The nature in Fuchsia City is our pride and joy!\nTherefore, we must all cherish and protect\nour environment!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0603_0701_01_10": "Venomoth, a Pokémon that inhabits the Kanto\nregion, looks very beautiful.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0603_0701_02_10": "However, behind that beauty, it hides a\ndeadly poison.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0603_0701_03_10": "Beautiful things often hide their share of danger.\nRemember that for the future.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0603_0702_01_10": "Fwahaha! A long time ago, I was hit by\nVenomoth’s poison.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0603_0702_02_10": "But it was through that experience that I became\ninterested in Poison-type Pokémon. It was\nthrough that I became the man in front of you!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0604_0701_01_10": "My Crobat hunts his prey swiftly and silently.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0604_0701_02_10": "Would you not say that he is a ninja’s\nperfect partner?",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0604_0701_03_10": "Of course, if I am not careful, he tries to\nsuck my blood!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0604_0702_01_10": "Crobat and I are equals. Words do no justice to\nwhat we share.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0604_0702_02_10": "Perhaps trying to suck my blood is his way of\nshowing me affection.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0701_01_10": "If you’re going to be battling all sorts of pairs,\nmake sure you choose the type of moves\nthat your opponents are weak against.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0701_02_10": "Fwahaha! As long as you can find \nyour opponent’s weakness, you’ll have\nan edge in any Pokémon battle!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0701_03_10": "If you know not only what the opposing Pokémon\nare weak to but also what yours are weak to...",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0701_04_10": "you will be able to identify both opportunities\nand crises!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0702_01_10": "Now that I’ve warned you to look out for\nyour opponent’s weaknesses, you understand\nwhat that means, yes?",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0702_02_10": "It means that I challenge you!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/0605_0702_03_10": "I am intrigued to see how you will deal with my\nPokémon and my techniques!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/1701_0701_01_10": "I have a gift for you!\nI’m sure you will find a good use for it!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/1701_0702_01_10": "Pokémon are both smart and strong.\nYou are the only one, however, that can\nlead them to victory using items.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/1701_0702_02_10": "Make sure to find the best use for it.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0701_01_10": "You have become much stronger than when we\nfirst met!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0701_02_10": "Your desire to improve is splendid!\nI truly want you as an apprentice!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0701_03_10": "I enjoy watching your remarkable growth!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0702_01_10": "Even one that has lived on a single track as a\nninja and a Pokémon Trainer has something to\nlearn from your Pokémon handling.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0702_02_10": "I wonder, if I introduced you to my training and\nteachings, would you become even stronger?",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2501_0702_03_10": "Fwahaha! No, I will not force you. But if you are\never interested, come talk to me!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0701_01_10": "It is sobering to see how quickly young Trainers\nbecome stronger.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0701_02_10": "Whether through my daughter, Janine, or you...",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0701_03_10": "it is very possible I’ll have the privilege to see\none of my students grow to new heights and\nleave splendid results!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0701_04_10": "I would like you to be my daughter’s rival.\nThe two of you would be perfect for honing\neach other’s skills!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0702_01_10": "Janine claims that her skill in both Pokémon\nbattles and ninja arts are not adequate.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0702_02_10": "If she had somebody to bounce off, I’m sure\nshe would be able to grow, too.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0702_03_10": "Not to mention, I am certain that you could learn\nsomething from her as well.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/2511_0702_04_10": "I look forward to the growth the two of you\nwill display!",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3001_0701_01_10": "If you find yourself struggling to wake up\nin the morning, I suggest splashing your\nface with cold water.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3002_0701_01_10": "It has become my routine to rise\nwith the sun in the morning.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3003_0701_01_10": "Fwahaha! Time to apply my ninja techniques\nto the lunch my lovely daughter made me.\n",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3004_0701_01_10": "Rigorous daily training is the key\nto securing glorious victory.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3005_0701_01_10": "True ninjas adapt to the darkness and make it\ntheir home by becoming one with the night.",
    "ch0054_00_kyo/3006_0701_01_10": "You still seem full of energy.\nThat is excellent! Continue your training!"
