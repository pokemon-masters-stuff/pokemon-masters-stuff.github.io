    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0200_10": "Yup! We just beat the Champion Stadium for the\nfirst time!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0300_10": "I see. If you want a few pointers, I’d be happy\nto share what I’ve learned. How about we\ntrain together?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0400_10": "Sure! That’d be great!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0500_10": "It might be easier to understand three-on-three\nbattles with rental Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0600_10": "They’re the right fit for this training, and they’re\nhappy to help out!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0700_10": "*chuckle* What a lively friend.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0800_10": "I can teach you about sync pair roles and tactics—\nand by “tactics” I mean the order in which your\nopponent will target sync pairs on your team.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_0900_10": "First, roles describe what a sync pair does.\nLet me break them down for you.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1000_10": "Strike sync pairs are great at attacking, but they\nalso take a lot of damage when they’re hit.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1100_10": "Support sync pairs are great at strengthening\nallies and restoring HP. They’re able to take\nhits, but they’re not so great at attacking.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1200_10": "There’s also tech sync pairs. They can do all\nsorts of things, from inflicting status conditions\nto changing the weather.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1300_10": "The best way to optimize these roles is to keep\nthem in mind when selecting your tactics—the\norder in which your sync pairs will get attacked!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1400_10": "For example, even if you have a sync pair with a\npowerful attack, they won’t be able to use it as\nmuch if they’re the first on your team to get KO’d.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1500_10": "Ohhh, I get it! So it’s probably best to have a\nsupport sync pair get targeted first, because\nthey’re better suited for taking hits!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1600_10": "Correct. Why don’t we put it into practice and\nlearn a bit about strike and support sync pairs in\na battle?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4001_1001_1700_10": "As you’re putting your team together, try thinking\nabout a strategy for who gets targeted in\nwhat order!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4002_1001_0100_10": "Great. You’ve done well to consider roles and\ntactics in battle. Why don’t you go on ahead?\nYou might learn even more!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4002_1001_0200_10": "Thanks, N! You sure taught us a lot!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4002_1001_0300_10": "Thank you, too, Scolipede!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4002_1001_0400_10": "Let’s keep going, shall we?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0100_10": "Heeeey! Over here!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0200_10": "We were waiting for you! We can teach you\nabout the importance of using sync moves.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0300_10": "Oh, I know all about that! Sync moves are a\nlot more powerful than regular moves!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0400_10": "It’s not just that they’re powerful.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0500_10": "Yeah! Right after you use a sync move, you get\nthis cool thing called a sync buff!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0600_10": "A sync buff?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0700_10": "That’s right! Every time you use a sync move,\nyour team’s attacks will become more powerful!\nThat’s what a sync buff is!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0800_10": "The more sync buffs you get, the stronger your\nteam will be!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_0900_10": "But remember, your opponents get sync buffs\nwhen they use their sync moves, too.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_1000_10": "That’s why it’s important to use a lot of moves\nas quickly as you can to reduce your sync\nmove countdown.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_1100_10": "But using moves depletes your move gauge,\nso you have to get creative about how to battle\nwithout running out of move gauge slots!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_1200_10": "Yep! Trainer moves don’t use up any slots,\nand they still count toward your sync\nmove countdown!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_1300_10": "Oh, really? Then maybe it’s a good idea to use\na lot of Trainer moves!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4003_1001_1400_10": "OK! Let’s test that out in battle!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4004_1001_0100_10": "Great! You had your entire team use a lot of\nmoves quickly so you could use your sync move!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4004_1001_0200_10": "See how much of an advantage you get if\nyou build up your sync buffs faster than\nyour opponent?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4004_1001_0300_10": "Yes! Thank you so much, everyone!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4004_1001_0400_10": "You’ve totally got this! I’m rooting for you!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0100_10": "Hey there! I bet you’re here to learn\nsomething new!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0200_10": "Yup! We’re training to become super champions!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0300_10": "Sounds great! Well then, I suppose I could give\nyou a tip or two...",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0400_10": "You know about moves that can strengthen\na Pokémon’s stats, right?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0500_10": "There’s a lot to choose from, but ones that can\nraise your Pokémon’s Attack or Sp. Atk are\nimportant, as they help you deal more damage!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0600_10": "One thing to watch out for is how moves are\ncategorized. That determines which stat you\nshould focus on raising!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0700_10": "The Attack stat strengthens physical attack moves,\nwhile Sp. Atk strengthens special attack moves.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0800_10": "You can tell which category a move falls under\nby the icon shown next to it.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_0900_10": "Before you head out to battle, it’s always a good\nidea to check which categories your team’s moves\nfall under!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_1000_10": "Got it!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4005_1001_1100_10": "OK, let’s jump right into some practice!\nThink you can rack up some damage\neven with a rental Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4006_1001_0100_10": "Awesome! You’ve got it down pat!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4006_1001_0200_10": "By focusing on raising either Attack or Sp. Atk,\nyou can find efficient ways to deal more damage\nwith your attack moves!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4006_1001_0300_10": "I think I saw Wallace up ahead. I bet he’d have\na few pointers for you as well!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4006_1001_0400_10": "Thank you so much, Steven!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0100_10": "I see you’ve come for some training! How\nmarvelous to see Trainers working so hard to\nbe their best selves!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0200_10": "Perhaps I can be of some help. You’ve already\nspoken with Steven, right?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0300_10": "Yup! He taught us all about Attack and Sp. Atk!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0400_10": "Great. Then I can teach you a few things about\nDefense and Sp. Def.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0500_10": "These two stats determine how much damage is\nreduced when your Pokémon is hit by an\nopponent’s attack move, much like a shield.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0600_10": "And just like with Attack and Sp. Atk, the amount\nof damage a move deals can change depending\non which category the move falls under.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0700_10": "Defense reduces damage from physical attack\nmoves, while Sp. Def reduces damage from\nspecial attack moves.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0800_10": "If you’re struggling with a tough opponent, it may\nbe because you need to raise the stat that’s strong\nagainst the category of the moves they’re using.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_0900_10": "There are also certain moves that can raise your\nallies’ Defense and Sp. Def!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_1000_10": "In fact, lots of support sync pairs can use Trainer\nmoves that do just that!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_1100_10": "Moves that can protect your allies? How lovely!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4007_1001_1200_10": "OK, time to give it a go. Try to defend yourself\nagainst my attacks!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4008_1001_0100_10": "How wonderful! And elegant—infuriatingly so!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4008_1001_0200_10": "You can better protect your team by knowing\nwhich stat to raise—Defense or Sp. Def!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4008_1001_0300_10": "I wish you the best on your journey to become\nsuper champions!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4008_1001_0400_10": "Thanks a bunch, Wallace!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0100_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! I was waiting\nfor you lot to show up!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0200_10": "Are you training here, too, Leon?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0300_10": "Actually, I was going to ask Blue and his team for\na battle...",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0400_10": "But I heard all about what you’re doing, and I\ndecided to help you out instead!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0500_10": "After all, my dream is for everyone to get\nstronger together!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0600_10": "First, let’s have ourselves a battle!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4009_1001_0700_10": "I’ll figure out what I can teach you from how\nyou battle!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4010_1001_0100_10": "Aw... No way!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4010_1001_0200_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ]’s attacks weren’t\ndealing much damage...",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0100_10": "I see! I know exactly what I can teach you, then!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0200_10": "I’ll explain how to use critical hits!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0300_10": "What’re those?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0400_10": "When you land a critical hit, it increases the\namount of damage you deal to your opponent.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0500_10": "But that’s not all! Even if your opponent tries to\nraise their Defense or Sp. Def, it won’t affect your\ncritical-hit damage!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0600_10": "Critical hits also ignore other field effects that\nreduce physical or special damage!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0700_10": "In other words, you can use a critical hit to deal\nsignificant damage despite almost anything\nyour opponent does to strengthen their defenses!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0800_10": "But how do we even land a critical hit to\nbegin with?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_0900_10": "Essentially, what you can do is use a Trainer move\nthat raises your critical-hit rate!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_1000_10": "You can only raise your critical-hit rate by up\nto three ranks, but that should be plenty!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_1100_10": "If you’re able to do that, most of your attacks will\nbe critical hits!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_1200_10": "Why don’t you take this? It’s a Trainer move that\ncan raise your critical-hit rate!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1101_1300_20": "[Name:PlayerNickname ] learned Dire Hit +!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4011_1001_1400_10": "In this next battle, try focusing on landing\ncritical hits!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0100_10": "Yes, those were some excellent attacks!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0200_10": "Use this in Hard mode in the Champion Stadium,\nand your attacks will really pack a punch!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0300_10": "Er...but don’t forget—your opponents can also\nuse critical hits against you, too!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0400_10": "If your opponent tries to land critical hits on you,\nyou can try recovering HP before they come\nat you with a big attack!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0500_10": "I see... So we need to keep an eye on our\nopponent’s critical-hit rate, too!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4012_1001_0600_10": "Thank you, Leon!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0100_10": "Oh! Hi there! Are you here for training, too?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0200_10": "We sure are! We’re learning a lot from all the\nexperienced Trainers here!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0300_10": "I can tell just by the looks on your faces that\nyou’ve learned quite a bit.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0400_10": "How’s your knowledge of passive skills?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0500_10": "Um... I’m not so confident when it comes to those.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0600_10": "Passive skills are skills that automatically activate\nwhen certain conditions are met during battle.\nThey have all sorts of effects!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0700_10": "It’s probably easiest to understand the passive\nskills that activate when you either attack or are\nattacked by an opponent.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0800_10": "Now that I think about it...",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_0900_10": "Sometimes in battle, I see Pokémon undergoing\nall sorts of changes that aren’t always moves or\nfield effects!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_1000_10": "You might say that passive skills are the biggest\ntraits a sync pair can possess.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_1100_10": "Optimize your team with strategies that use\npassive skills to your advantage!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_1200_10": "OK, that should be enough of a lecture for now.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4013_1001_1300_10": "Let’s have a battle and put these passive skills\nto the test!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0100_10": "Great! You pulled that off very well.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0200_10": "There are passive skills that you may already\nknow as a sync pair...",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0300_10": "But you can also learn extra passive skills from\nlucky skills!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0400_10": "Here. I have an item you can use to learn\na lucky skill.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0500_10": "Thanks!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0600_10": "Oh, I know about these! When you break open\nthese lucky cookies, you’ll find a random skill inside\nthat you can learn!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4014_1001_0700_10": "Best of luck. I know you can do it!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0100_10": "Yo! You finally made it!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0200_10": "Blue?!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0300_10": "Red and Leaf are here, too! But why?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0400_10": "Heh. We’re gonna see how much you’ve learned\nhere on Victory Road!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0500_10": "Think of it as a graduation test of sorts!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0600_10": "On top of facing challengers, I gotta make sure\nthe younger Trainers are getting better, too.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0700_10": "Man, it sure is a lot of work, being a genius\nlike me!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0800_10": "Oh, is that so?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_0900_10": "Red and I were totally fine coming here by\nourselves, but I seem to recall someone just\nBEGGING us to let him in on this, no?",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_1000_10": "A-anyway!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_1100_10": "Why don’t you show us what you’ve learned!\nGive us all you’ve got!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4015_1001_1200_10": "I’m sure you’re already aware, but we’re not\ngonna go easy on ya!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0100_10": "...Heh.",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0200_10": "Well done! You pass with flying colors!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0300_10": "We did it, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0400_10": "I’m sure you’ll do just fine in Hard mode!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0500_10": "We’ll help you out, too, as a little present for\ncompleting this training!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0600_10": "Who you choose is up to you!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0700_10": "Really? That’s amazing!",
    "episode_event_battleliteracy/4016_1001_0800_10": "Whoa. Looks like we’ve got ourselves quite the\ncelebration party!"
