    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2100_10": "And sync stones react to that strength, making\nthem glitter even more brightly.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2200_10": "But you already knew that, didn’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2300_10": "Due to my status as a Champion, I get challenged\nto Pokémon battles constantly here on Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2400_10": "But one of the great things about that is that I get\nto see everyone’s sync stones shine whenever\nI battle!",

    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2800_10": "Don’t get me wrong—I’m incredibly pleased by\nthat fact.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_2900_10": "But I believe there’s a well of even greater\npotential hidden within these stones.",

    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_4300_10": "that strength really does seem to reflect in their\nsync stone.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_4400_10": "Just like how polishing a gemstone makes\nit sparkle, it seems we sync pairs need to\nhone our skills in order to shine as well!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_4500_10": "Please, will you join me again sometime soon?\nI’d like to polish our battling skills together!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_0301_4600_10": "Absolutely!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_0401_4700_10": "Great answer! I knew my instincts about you\nwere correct.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_0302_4800_10": "I don’t plan on losing!",

    "charaepi_ch0090_00_daigo/2301_1201_5100_10": "Although...",
