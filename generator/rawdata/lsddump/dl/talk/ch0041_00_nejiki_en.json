    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0601_0701_03_10": "you can actually lose consciousness for\nseveral moments. So make sure you don’t\nEVER do that, OK?",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0601_0702_01_10": "Electivire are incredibly rare to\nfind in the wild, you know.",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0601_0702_02_10": "If you ever manage to team up with one,\nyou can be sure it will be a dependable partner.",

    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0602_0702_01_10": "This is just the mobile version of my\ndata-interpreting machine, but it’s got\namazing functionality!",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0602_0702_02_10": "I’ll tell you all about what this baby\ncan do next time.",

    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0604_0701_02_10": "In other words, you’d like to interpret\nmy data. Is that correct?\nIf so, feel free!",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0604_0701_03_10": "Let’s see. Um... Male, teenager...\nNo, that’s not the sort of data you\nwant, is it?",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0604_0701_04_10": "If you want to learn more about me, you’ll\nneed to collect some data. Spending time\nwith me is the best way to do that.",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0604_0701_05_10": "It just so happens that I’m interested\nin collecting some data on you as well.\nNice timing!",

    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0605_0701_02_10": "I’m really specific about how I do it,\nbut it doesn’t take long at all.",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0605_0701_03_10": "That could be because I use my invention\nthe Auto-Hairstyle-O-Matic to analyze\nmy hair type.",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/0605_0701_04_10": "Want to try it out, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nMy invention can turn any hairstyle\ninto one that’s just like mine.",

    "ch0041_00_nejiki/2501_0701_03_10": "Don’t worry—I don’t need you to do\nanything super specific. I just need to\nlook at you through my machine!",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/2501_0702_01_10": "Bzweeeeep!\nOh, don’t let the beeping concern you.\nI’m just interpreting some of your data.",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/2501_0702_02_10": "You and your Pokémon continue to\nexceed my calculations.\nWhat’s the secret to your strength?",

    "ch0041_00_nejiki/2511_0701_03_10": "Pokémon get disappointed when they lose\nbattles, too. That’s why you’ve got to\nformulate new strategies!",
    "ch0041_00_nejiki/2511_0701_04_10": "So that you can learn from your mistakes!\nAnd so next time, you can win!\nAnd things will go exactly as planned!",
