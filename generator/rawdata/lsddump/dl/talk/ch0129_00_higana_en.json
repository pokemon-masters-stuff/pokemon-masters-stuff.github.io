    "ch0129_00_higana/0101_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nI was just thinking about you.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m curious to see what you accomplish here\non Pasio...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0701_01_10": "Pasio’s full of all sorts of people, huh?\nChampions, Gym Leaders, and the like.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0701_02_10": "But just because someone’s got a sparkling\njob title doesn’t mean they can’t be beat.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0701_03_10": "This world’s got so much potential... Anyone can\npush their way to the top if they put their mind\nto it.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0701_04_10": "Haha! Whatever, right? Just ignore me and my\nphilosophical rambling for now, and have some\nfun watching your story unfold!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0702_01_10": "You and your Pokémon should tell me your story\nsometime. I’d love to hear it.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0601_0702_02_10": "You’d better let me be part of your adventure at\nsome point, too, OK? Don’t leave me hanging!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0701_01_10": "Who am I? Who am I, really? It’s a question\neveryone probably asks themselves at some point\nin their life.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0701_02_10": "It’s definitely something I had to ask myself once.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0701_03_10": "I spent some time in the Hoenn region, and the\npeople I met there helped me sort of discover\nwho I am.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0701_04_10": "It’s thanks to them that I’m able to answer that\nquestion now.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0701_05_10": "So, y’know, I can say that I’m Zinnia, and my\npartner is Rayquaza.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0702_01_10": "Think you’ll ever meet someone who totally turns\nyour world upside down?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0602_0702_02_10": "What if that were me? Ahaha!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0701_01_10": "Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve always turned\nmy eyes up to the sky.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0701_02_10": "No matter how uncertain or grief-stricken or\nalone I felt, I turned and looked up there...\nso that my tears would never, ever fall.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0701_03_10": "Looking up at the sky brings back a lot of\nmemories for me.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0701_04_10": "The people I met back in Hoenn, the Pokémon\nI encountered...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0701_05_10": "Guess I’ve been through a lot! Heh...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0702_01_10": "What about you? Do you ever do that sort\nof thing?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0702_02_10": "We should go stargazing sometime, me and you.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0603_0702_03_10": "We can get lost in our thoughts on infinite\nuniverses and galaxies far away.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0701_01_10": "Do you have someone or something you’d want\nto protect at all costs? Something greater\nthan yourself?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0701_02_10": "If the answer is yes, you should remember this...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0701_03_10": "Try not to take things for granted—especially the\nthings you really care about.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0701_04_10": "You never know... One day, they could suddenly\ndisappear, lost forever.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0701_05_10": "I mean, it’s your job to make sure nothing like\nthat ever happens, but you can’t be too careful.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0702_01_10": "They say you can never truly know how much\nsomething means to you until it’s gone.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0604_0702_02_10": "I wonder if we even realize how much we love\nthe things we want to protect.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0701_01_10": "If you had to make a sacrifice in order to protect\nsomething or someone, what would you do,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0701_02_10": "Would you take a step back, and just see what\nhappens? Let everything play out?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0701_03_10": "Or would you jump in and try to do something\nabout it, even if it meant making a sacrifice?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0701_04_10": "No... You probably wouldn’t settle for either of\nthose options, would you?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0701_05_10": "You’d probably try to figure out a way to save\neveryone and everything you could, huh?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0702_01_10": "With all of the different people and Pokémon you\ninteract with, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/0605_0702_02_10": "I bet your list of precious things you’d give\neverything to protect gets longer every day.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/1701_0701_01_10": "Niiice! Full points to you for being at the\nright place at the right time!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/1701_0701_02_10": "Here, have a reward to celebrate!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/1701_0702_01_10": "May you treasure this precious gift that I have\nbestowed upon you until the end of your days...",
    "ch0129_00_higana/1701_0702_02_10": "Haha! I’m kidding, I’m kidding. It’s all yours.\nUse it however you like!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0701_01_10": "While I was traveling through the Hoenn region,\nI had a Whismur as my partner. Her name’s Aster.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0701_02_10": "She’s so darned adorable—especially the way she\nlikes to nuzzle up against me and make the cutest\nlittle noises.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0701_03_10": "Aster and I were always together...in good times\nand in bad. ",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0701_04_10": "While we were in Hoenn, we were kind of like\na sync pair in that way.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0701_05_10": "If she hadn’t stuck with me through that journey,\nI don’t know if I’d be where I am today.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0702_01_10": "We can’t go through our lives alone, and neither\ncan Pokémon. We need each other.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2501_0702_02_10": "Buuuut! You’ve got plenty of imagination, right?\nI’m sure you know that without me having to\ntell you.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0701_01_10": "When I’m around you, I sometimes get this really\nwarm, nostalgic feeling.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0701_02_10": "I think it’s a good thing, though. It tells me that\nI have a friend around that I can really trust.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0701_03_10": "Thanks to you, I think I’ll be able to forge a new\nbeginning. Turns out my story’s not over after all.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0701_04_10": "It could be interesting...trying to imagine how it’ll\nall unfurl now that I’ve teamed up with you.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0702_01_10": "How do you think our story’ll turn out in the end?\nI’d be curious to hear your theories sometime.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/2511_0702_02_10": "Show me some imagination! Haha!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3001_0701_01_10": "Gooood morning! Hope you slept well.\nNo time to dawdle today!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3002_0701_01_10": "Hmm... Let’s try to guess what kind of\nadventures are in store for us today.\nC’mon, use your imagination!",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3003_0701_01_10": "I wonder what it’d be like to just relaaax and\ndo nothing for a day... Sounds kinda nice.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3004_0701_01_10": "The sky is always the same, no matter where\nyou are... Wait, that’s not right. It’s actually\npretty different.",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3005_0701_01_10": "The stars are so beautiful tonight. Reminds me of\nwhen I... Ahem. Sooo, how was your day?",
    "ch0129_00_higana/3006_0701_01_10": "Wow, I can’t believe it’s already this late!\nMaybe we should leave things here for today\nand get some rest."
