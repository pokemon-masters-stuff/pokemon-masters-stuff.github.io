    "ch0021_01_green/0101_0701_02_10": "I know you’re going out exploring again today,\nright? You’re aiming for the top here in Pasio,\nafter all!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0601_0701_01_10": "Hey, check out this outfit. Pretty cool, right?",
    "ch0021_01_green/0601_0701_02_10": "Some serious craftsmanship went into making it, so\nit’s perfect for battles where I take center stage!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0601_0701_03_10": "Losing isn’t an option in an outfit like this! That\nwouldn’t be cool at all.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0601_0701_04_10": "You’ll see! Blastoise and I are gonna show\neveryone just how incredible we are!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0602_0701_01_10": "Pasio is the perfect place for sync pairs to\ngrow stronger.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0602_0701_02_10": "All you gotta do is go out and explore as much\nas you can whenever you have time.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0602_0701_03_10": "Spending time with your partner Pokémon lets you\nlearn surprising new things about it, and it gives\nyou a chance to reflect on yourself, too.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0602_0701_04_10": "There’s a lot to be gained from it for both you and\nyour Pokémon.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0603_0701_01_10": "The jets of water that Blastoise fires can even\npierce through thick iron plates!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0603_0701_02_10": "With Blastoise by my side, I can blast right through\nany obstacle!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0603_0701_03_10": "Well, other than Red, that is. I still can’t figure out\nhow to beat him.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0603_0701_04_10": "We’ll beat him one day, though! And, when we\ndo, Blastoise and I will be the strongest duo in\nthe world!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0604_0701_01_10": "My Blastoise has been with me since he was\na Squirtle.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0604_0701_02_10": "He’s always been a gutsy Pokémon and as loyal\nas can be...",
    "ch0021_01_green/0604_0701_03_10": "but he’s become even more reliable ever since\nhe evolved into Blastoise!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0604_0701_04_10": "He’s my partner Pokémon, and I know he’s got\nmy back!",
    "ch0021_01_green/0605_0701_01_10": "You’re another Trainer I’m focused on beating,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]. Just like Red.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0605_0701_02_10": "I admit, I consider you a rival.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0605_0701_03_10": "It’s a little scary to watch you get stronger and\nstronger, but it’s also kind of exciting.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0605_0701_04_10": "More strong Trainers means more worthwhile\nbattles—which is a plus, of course—but there’s\nmore to it than that.",
    "ch0021_01_green/0605_0701_05_10": "Maybe I’m just happy to watch you grow and\nmature as a person, too.",
    "ch0021_01_green/1701_0701_01_10": "Yo! I was looking for you. There’s something I\nwant you to have.",
    "ch0021_01_green/1701_0701_02_10": "It’ll definitely come in handy in your adventures.\nMake good use of it, OK?",
    "ch0021_01_green/1701_0702_01_10": "You can’t be a good Trainer if you don’t know\nhow to use items properly.",
    "ch0021_01_green/1701_0702_02_10": "Knowing when to use each item is an important\npart of strategy!",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0701_01_10": "The most important element of Pokémon battles\nhere on Pasio is teamwork between sync pairs.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0701_02_10": "No matter how strong a single sync pair is, they\ncan’t make full use of that strength without proper\ncoordination with their team.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0701_03_10": "When I first battled alongside you, I was worried\nthat you might not be able to keep up with me.\nNot anymore, though.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0701_04_10": "Now I consider you a trustworthy sync pair to\nhave by my side in battles!",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0702_01_10": "We’re here to help out when you’re in need.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0702_02_10": "I better not catch you trying to do everything\nby yourself, OK?",
    "ch0021_01_green/2501_0702_03_10": "I put a lot of trust in you. Feel free to return the\nfavor, too, OK?",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0701_01_10": "You should travel the world someday.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0701_02_10": "Sure, there’s no shortage of encounters here on\nPasio, but the world is full of mysteries waiting to\nbe discovered.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0701_03_10": "I’m not just talking about new people and\nPokémon, either. There are plenty of new things\nto discover in nature, too.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0701_04_10": "A Pokémon Trainer’s journey never ends!",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0701_05_10": "I’m sure you’ll feel the same way when you see\njust how big this world really is.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0702_01_10": "Traveling around the world can be pretty tough,\nbut I’m sure you’ll be fine.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0702_02_10": "You’ll always have your Pokémon by your side,\nafter all.",
    "ch0021_01_green/2511_0702_03_10": "Besides, you can always rely on me, the mighty\nBlue, whenever you’re in a tight spot!",
    "ch0021_01_green/3002_0701_01_10": "You look like you’re still half asleep. All right,\nthink fast! Pokémon battle, right now! Relax, I’m\njust messin’ with ya.",
    "ch0021_01_green/3003_0701_01_10": "I had no idea this outfit would make such a big\ndifference. I feel way closer to my partner\nPokémon now. It’s like I’m never really alone.",
    "ch0021_01_green/3005_0701_01_10": "All right, I’m turning in for the night. When you’re\nas awesome as me, you take care of business\nfast and go home early!"
