    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_1201_0400_10": "I suppose it gets colder than other regions, and the\nweather can get pretty intense, too. We get snow,\nvolcanic ash, and everything in between!",
    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_1201_0500_10": "Whoa! That cold, huh? Sinnoh sounds wild!",
    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_1201_0600_10": "I wonder if a Trainer battles differently depending\non whether they’re from a warm region or a cold\nregion. Let’s test it out!",
    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_0101_0100_10": "OK, let’s do this!",
    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_0501_0100_10": "That was awesome! I think I kinda understand\nSinnoh’s vibe a little better now!",
    "charaepi_ch0116_00_hikari/2311_0501_0200_10": "I had so much fun, too! I could practically feel the\nAlolan breeze blowing through my hair!",
