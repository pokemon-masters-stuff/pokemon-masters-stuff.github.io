    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0101_0701_02_10": "Heh heh, so...\nLet’s get exploring!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0701_01_10": "What are you staring at?\nDon’t be so rude.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0701_02_10": "Are you...impressed by my clothing?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0701_03_10": "Well, there must be more to you than meets the\neye if you understand the beauty of this style!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0701_04_10": "This is the ultimate fashion, appropriate for\nthe ultimate Gym Leader!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0701_05_10": "No, it’s not strange—and I’m not embarrassed\nto be wearing it, either!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0702_01_10": "Heh, it’s not a bad feeling to have an admirer.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0601_0702_02_10": "Very well! You may admire me to your\nheart’s content!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0701_01_10": "Do you know the famous dragon Trainer, Lance?\nHe’s actually my cousin.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0701_02_10": "But he never acknowledges my skill, even though\nwe’re both dragon users!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0701_03_10": "Isn’t that just awful?\nWhat could possibly be lacking from me?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0701_04_10": "I wonder—is there truly something lacking\nin me?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0702_01_10": "Oh, no, it’s not that I don’t like him.\nI just feel a little disgruntled is all.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0602_0702_02_10": "Don’t you dare tell anyone I said that, though!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0701_01_10": "Kingdra is a very special being to me.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0701_02_10": "She’s strong, beautiful, and tough.\nHer regal form is truly fitting of her name!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0701_03_10": "And sometimes, when things don’t go\nthe way I’d like them to, she comforts me.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0701_04_10": "Kingdra looks positively divine, I know, but...",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0701_05_10": "She also has a very beautiful heart.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0603_0702_01_10": "Kingdra and I are like two hearts beating as one.\nThat’s why we’re the greatest sync pair of all.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0701_01_10": "It can be difficult to raise Dragon-type Pokémon.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0701_02_10": "But if you don’t give up and take things slow\nand steady, they’ll always come through for you.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0701_03_10": "Unfortunately, some Trainers do just give up in\nthe face of the challenge.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0701_04_10": "So one of my goals is to teach such Trainers the\nproper way of raising Dragon types.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0701_05_10": "I don’t want there to be any more unhappy\nPokémon or Trainers.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0702_01_10": "If you want to become a Dragon-type user,\nyour first step should be to find a Pokémon\nyou really like.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0604_0702_02_10": "It’s always best to raise a Pokémon you like.\nAnd then, someday, we can have a\nDragon-type showdown!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey! [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0701_02_10": "There should be lots you can learn from me,\nthe world’s best Dragon-type master!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0701_03_10": "If you insist, I wouldn’t mind personally\ntraining you.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0701_04_10": "Hee hee, once the PML is over, come visit me.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0701_05_10": "I’ll make you my apprentice!\nThink of the honor!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/0605_0702_01_10": "Well, that’s settled! You’ll come to me!\nYou promised now, so no backing out!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/1701_0701_01_10": "Hey, one moment.\nUh, well... Here, you can have this.\nI just happened to come across it.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/1701_0701_02_10": "Take it.\nIf you don’t want it, you don’t have to keep it.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/1701_0702_01_10": "Since I personally gave you a gift, you should\ntreat it like it’s me and treasure it.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/1701_0702_02_10": "Oh! But no holding back, though!\nUse it whenever you need it!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_01_10": "I can feel it!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_02_10": "You’re getting very interested in Dragon-type\nPokémon, aren’t you?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_03_10": "Hmph, well, I can understand being drawn to\npowerful beings!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_04_10": "But Dragon-type Pokémon are proud creatures\nof legend!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_05_10": "They won’t warm up to you so easily!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0701_06_10": "They only lend their strength to Trainers who\nare truly worthy.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0702_01_10": "It can be difficult to truly bond with one, but a\nDragon-type Pokémon is definitely the best\nPokémon to have as a partner!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2501_0702_02_10": "I think you will become obsessed with them, too.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_01_10": "To me, defeat is an impossibility.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_02_10": "Victory is everything.\nThat’s how I’ve always battled.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_03_10": "That’s the only way I can show the strength of\nKingdra and me.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_04_10": "That’s why we have to win, no matter who\nwe’re facing.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_05_10": "Yes, I’ve always felt like I didn’t want to\nlose for my own sake, but from now...",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0701_06_10": "No, never mind.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0702_01_10": "You’re someone who I’m willing to admit is\nstrong, OK?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0702_02_10": "So I won’t forgive you if you lose to anyone\nother than me.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/2511_0702_03_10": "Promise me you won’t lose to anyone! Promise!",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3001_0701_01_10": "Did you wake up early just\nso you could waste time?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3002_0701_01_10": "I have some time to talk, if you\ndon’t have anything else to do.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3003_0701_01_10": "Why don’t you get moving instead of\nwasting time fooling around?",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3004_0701_01_10": "Good weather today. I’m in a good mood,\nso I suppose I can spend time with you.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3005_0701_01_10": "Staying up late is bad for you.\nGet some rest while you can.",
    "ch0028_00_ibuki/3006_0701_01_10": "You’re still awake? Well, I suppose I could\nkeep you company, if you insist."
