    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1101_0200_20": "The two of them appeared to be roping off \nan area of the beach for themselves...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_0300_10": "Hey, you! Stop right there!\nThis is MY beach! Go away!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_0400_10": "Uhh... Was I not clear the first time?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_0500_10": "The sand here is super soft.\nIt doesn’t hurt at all when you fall down on it.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_0600_10": "So I’m turning this area into a training ground \nfor me and my Tepig! Right now! Got it?\nWe’re claiming this sand!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0301_0700_10": "Uh, OK.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0302_0800_10": "Um, I don’t think so.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_0900_10": "Hey! What do you think you’re doing over there?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1000_10": "Leave [Name:PlayerNickname ] alone!\nIf you want a battle, you can battle with me!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1100_10": "Hmph... A Starmie?\nThat wouldn’t be good for my Tepig...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1200_10": "Ugh. Fine, whatever! I guess you can have\nthis spot, then! Go on, take it! It’s yours!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1300_10": "Phew... I think she’s gone. I can’t believe she\npicked a fight with you like that!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1400_10": "Are you OK?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0301_1500_10": "I’m fine. Thanks.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0401_1600_10": "I’m glad nothing bad happened. \nBut even if it did, I’m sure you could \nhave taken them down in a pinch.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0302_1700_10": "Yeah. I’ll take care of the next one!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0402_1800_10": "All right! You probably could have \nwiped the floor with that sync pair just now, \neven if I hadn’t shown up.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_1900_10": "I kinda wish she would’ve stuck around a\nlittle longer! I would’ve liked to chase her off\nwith a Pokémon battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_2000_10": "See, the Starmie I have here is actually different\nfrom the one I used to battle with at my Gym.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_2100_10": "I left that Starmie at a Pokémon Day Care for\na little while, and the Pokémon Breeders found\nan Egg! That’s where this Starmie hatched from.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_2200_10": "It’s not very experienced yet, \nso I want to let it battle as much as I can.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_2300_10": "It’s definitely making progress, though!\nThe poor thing had a lot of trouble before it\nevolved, back when it was a Staryu...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0301_2400_10": "Trouble? Like what?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0401_2500_10": "Where do I begin? Sometimes it would fire its\nBubble Beam at the ground, and the recoil would\nsend it flying backwards...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0401_2600_10": "Or it would try to tackle its opponents with a\nbig jump, only to end up wedged into the sand\nbecause it overestimated the distance...",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0302_2700_10": "Is it a lot stronger now?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0402_2800_10": "It’s getting there, little by little! We still work\nreally hard with our day-to-day training.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0402_2900_10": "I’m always surprised by how peppy this Starmie is!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_0402_3000_10": "It never gets discouraged, even when we’re \ndoing really intense training drills. It’s amazing!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3100_10": "In any case, I want to do my best to make sure\nmy special pal here grows up nice and strong!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3200_10": "I feel like I owe it to my old buddy Starmie\nfor sticking with me through all those battles\nback at the Gym.",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3300_10": "By the way, if you ever need our help with\nanything, don’t hesitate to ask, OK?",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3400_10": "It’s all great training for Starmie in the end! And \nhelping people and Pokémon is super important!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3500_10": "Helping you would make me really happy!\nI love supporting younger Trainers like you\nalmost as much as I love raising up Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0110_00_kasumi/2301_1201_3600_10": "Either way, Starmie and I are looking forward to\nhaving tons more fun together from here on out!\nIt’s gonna be great!"
