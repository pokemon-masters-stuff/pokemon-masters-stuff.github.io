    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0101_0701_02_10": "Tee-hee! I’m only teasing.\nI hope you have a lovely day today.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0701_01_10": "Pasio is such a warm and comfortable\nisland, isn’t it? Quite amazing, really.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0701_02_10": "You know, if I could have a new villa\nbuilt here, it would be just perfect.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0701_03_10": "With my own villa, I could enjoy the city\nand natural landscapes here at my leisure.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0701_04_10": "You know what... I think I’ll consult\nmy butler, just in case.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0702_01_10": "If I ever do build a villa here,\nI’ll be sure to invite you.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0702_02_10": "Hmm... For the interior, I’m picturing\nroyal red carpets and a collection of\nart pieces from around the world.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0601_0702_03_10": "I can decorate with some of Reuniclus’s\nfavorite things as well. That way we can\nboth enjoy the space.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0701_01_10": "A long time ago, my psychic abilities used to\nmanifest whenever I lost control of my emotions.\nIt caused trouble for the people around me...",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0701_02_10": "Nowadays, I feel much stronger and I’m\nable to control those outbursts.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0701_03_10": "Back then, I was still so immature...",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0701_04_10": "But you know, I wouldn’t be the person\nI am today if I hadn’t experienced those\nthings in my past.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0702_01_10": "Changing something about yourself...\nIt’s not an easy task to accomplish,\nby any means.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0702_02_10": "But if there’s something you’d like to change\nor improve, I’ll be rooting for you.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0602_0702_03_10": "If I can do it...I’m certain you can, too.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0603_0701_01_10": "My Reuniclus likes to cause mischief\nwith her psychic abilities.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0603_0701_02_10": "Sometimes she moves the furniture around\nin my room without telling me...\nShe does that quite a lot, actually.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0603_0701_03_10": "I’d love to be able to rearrange my\nfurniture with mysterious psychic powers.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0603_0702_01_10": "Although, every time I try to rearrange\nmy furniture or clean my room myself,\nmy butler puts a stop to it.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0603_0702_02_10": "He insists that me trying to clean is no\ndifferent from my Reuniclus causing mischief...\nCan you believe that?",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0701_01_10": "When I couldn’t fall asleep at night,\nmy Gothitelle used to use her mysterious\npowers to create beautiful starry skies for me.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0701_02_10": "It was like having my own planetarium\nin my bedroom... Such precious memories.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0701_03_10": "Every moment I’m with my Pokémon\nis another beautiful memory. I gain\nmore and more of them each day.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0702_01_10": "I think we overdid it a little bit that night we\ncreated enough starry sky to cover the\nlargest room in the manor.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0702_02_10": "My butler smiled when he saw it,\nbut I’m quite sure he was shocked\nby the entire matter.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0604_0702_03_10": "Gothitelle and I immediately returned the\nroom to its previous state, but that was\nsort of fun in a way, too.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0701_01_10": "I haven’t yet reached what I would\ncall my perfect self.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0701_02_10": "But someday I will fulfill that dream...\nI’ll become the most elegant and most\ngraceful and refined Trainer of all.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0701_03_10": "And when I do, I’d like you to witness it.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0701_04_10": "Remember that, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0702_01_10": "If you have a goal in mind and it’s\nin my power to help you achieve it,\nI’m more than happy to lend a hand.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0702_02_10": "But triumphing over the final hurdle\nis something you must do with your\nown strength...",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/0605_0702_03_10": "Grasp onto victory with your own two hands,\nor it will fall apart before you know it.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/1701_0701_01_10": "Do you have a moment?\nI have something nice I’d like to give you.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/1701_0701_02_10": "It’s something I think you should have...\nI hope you find it useful.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/1701_0702_01_10": "Reuniclus often finds items like these for me.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/1701_0702_02_10": "She has a keen eye—notices things\nmuch more quickly than I do.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0701_01_10": "Where do you think you’re going?\nAre you just going to abandon me here?",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0701_02_10": "I was hoping you and I could have a\nPokémon battle...",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0701_03_10": "Tee-hee! I’m only teasing.\nI just love seeing that confused\nlook on your face.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0702_01_10": "I wasn’t lying when I said I wanted\nto battle with you, you know.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0702_02_10": "But I also want you to face all sorts\nof other Trainers first. I’d like to see\njust how strong you can become.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2501_0702_03_10": "When the day comes and you’re ready, I’d like\nfor you and I to have a grand battle...\nIs that too much to ask? Am I being selfish?",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2511_0701_01_10": "I’ve noticed that my mood tends to swing in\na certain direction whenever I’m around you.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2511_0701_02_10": "Oh! But I’m not talking about mood swings\nin the wild, uncontrollable sense.\nPerhaps that wasn’t the proper word to use.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2511_0701_03_10": "It’s more like...when I’m around you,\nI find it easier to express how I’m\nfeeling to other people and Pokémon.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2511_0702_01_10": "Sometimes, considering other people’s\nfeelings can actually make you a stronger\nperson yourself, huh.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/2511_0702_02_10": "I’m not sure I would have ever realized\nthat on my own had I not met you.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3001_0701_01_10": "My, you’re awfully energetic in the morning!\nCould that be the secret to your strength?",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3002_0701_01_10": "What a calm and refreshing morning.\nI think today will be a good day.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3003_0701_01_10": "Hello there. I’m so bored, I’m falling asleep...\nPerhaps I’m in need of a Pokémon battle or two.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3004_0701_01_10": "Good day. Wonderful weather, isn’t it?\nI was just contemplating heading out for a walk.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening.\nThe day goes by so fast, doesn’t it? Once you’ve\nfinished everything, you should rest, too.",
    "ch0095_00_cattleya/3006_0701_01_10": "Oh my, is it dark already?\nDon’t push yourself too hard."
