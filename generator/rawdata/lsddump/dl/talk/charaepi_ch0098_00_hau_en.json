    "charaepi_ch0098_00_hau/2301_1201_4500_10": "I guess he’s just hungry.\nHe doesn’t care for theories right now.",
    "charaepi_ch0098_00_hau/2301_1201_4600_10": "All right, forget training for today!\nLet’s all go get some pancakes!",
    "charaepi_ch0098_00_hau/2301_1201_4700_10": "Come with us, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nAnd once we’re done eating...",
