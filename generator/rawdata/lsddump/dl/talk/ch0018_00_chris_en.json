    "ch0018_00_chris/0101_0701_02_10": "I wonder what kind of new adventures we’ll\nhave today! Well, then we’re off!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0701_01_10": "I read up on Pokémon a good deal, you know?",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0701_02_10": "But just reading books doesn’t teach you\neverything about Pokémon.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0701_03_10": "That’s why you have to go out, walk with your\nown legs, and see them with your own eyes.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0701_04_10": "That way, you can see Pokémon for yourself.\nThe kind that aren’t just recorded as data!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0702_01_10": "I want to meet all the Pokémon in the world!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0601_0702_02_10": "Maybe you can call that my dream.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0701_01_10": "Understanding ecosystems and the mechanisms of\nEvolution is important, too...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0701_02_10": "But I’m more interested in the minds of\nthe Pokémon.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0701_03_10": "I want to know about what they think and how\nthey feel.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0701_04_10": "I want to understand their emotions so that we\ncan make the world more like how they want it.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0702_01_10": "If people and Pokémon could understand each\nother better, we could become even closer!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0602_0702_02_10": "Think about it! A world where we care for and\nhelp each other. Wouldn’t that be great?",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0701_01_10": "Totodile’s been with me the longest.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0701_02_10": "She has a little bit of a troublemaker streak,\nso I had my work cut out for me at the start.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0701_03_10": "She would try to bite me whenever she got the\nchance. It was pretty tough!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0701_04_10": "But in reality, she actually bit me only once.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0701_05_10": "I fell in a river once and almost drowned. But\nTotodile bit my hand to try and pull me out.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0702_01_10": "Seeing a river always reminds me of that day.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0603_0702_02_10": "And of how Totodile came swimming toward me\nfrom the light I saw at the bottom of that river.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0701_01_10": "It makes me sad whenever I see people showing\ntheir Pokémon affection in the wrong way.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0701_02_10": "They might be trying to make their\nPokémon happy...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0701_03_10": "but ultimately, their Pokémon might not like it\nor it might end up backfiring.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0701_04_10": "This happens because people don’t have \nthe right knowledge about their Pokémon.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0701_05_10": "I hope people can educate themselves so there\ncan be a lot less Pokémon that suffer.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0702_01_10": "Doing what each other wants might be\ntrue love...maybe.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0604_0702_02_10": "Love is difficult, isn’t it?\nBut then again, what do I know. Ha ha!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0701_01_10": "Looking at you, I always get to thinking...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0701_02_10": "that maybe you and your Pokémon are the ideal\nimage of how people and Pokémon should be.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0701_03_10": "Neither of you pushes yourself to get along with\nthe other. You just naturally do.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0701_04_10": "I’m pretty observant, aren’t I?",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0701_05_10": "It’s not just Pokémon that I observe, you know.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0702_01_10": "I might have been a Trainer longer than you...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/0605_0702_02_10": "but I have plenty I can learn from you, too!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, take this. A present from yours truly.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/1701_0701_02_10": "I’m sure it’ll help you out, so it’d be nice\nif you used it!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/1701_0702_01_10": "I sometimes get presents from people, too.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/1701_0702_02_10": "But this one time, I got one from a Pokémon!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0701_01_10": "Have you heard of the Legendary Pokémon?",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0701_02_10": "They’re Pokémon that rarely show themselves\nin front of people, if they even ever do.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0701_03_10": "A while back, I found a Legendary Pokémon\ncalled Suicune and chased it.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0701_04_10": "It was such a beautiful Pokémon. It looked pure\nand pristine, like a crystal.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0701_05_10": "If I ever run into Suicune again, I want to show\nit that I’ve grown up.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0702_01_10": "Being able to meet a Legendary Pokémon comes\nwith its fair share of hardships.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2501_0702_02_10": "Because it’s so rare to lay eyes on them, \nit’s that much more awe-inspiring when you do.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0701_01_10": "It’s a shame, but there are people in the world\nthat use Pokémon for evil.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0701_02_10": "I can never forgive people like that!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0701_03_10": "Not just because of the fact that they’re using\nPokémon to do bad things.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0701_04_10": "But even more than that, as Trainers, they are\nfailing their Pokémon!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0701_05_10": "Those Pokémon that are trusting those Trainers\nare betrayed. It pains my heart to see Pokémon\ngoing through that...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0702_01_10": "It would be great if you could show the world\nhow a Trainer and their Pokémon should be.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/2511_0702_02_10": "Not some twisted bond but a true connection\nbetween Pokémon and their Trainer.",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3001_0701_01_10": "It’s interesting how some Pokémon are\nwaking and some are going to sleep.\nTheir differences make them so fascinating!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3002_0701_01_10": "The earlier I wake up, the more chances\nI have to meet cool Pokémon!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3003_0701_01_10": "We’re going on another adventure to\nmeet new Pokémon today! Hehehe!",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3004_0701_01_10": "If I ever get info on a rare Pokémon,\nI’ll be sure to let you know, OK?",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3005_0701_01_10": "Pokémon that appear only at night \nare sure difficult to meet.\n*yawn* I’m sleepy...",
    "ch0018_00_chris/3006_0701_01_10": "Even on nights with no moonlight or stars, you\ncan still make out the Pokémon eyes in the dark."
