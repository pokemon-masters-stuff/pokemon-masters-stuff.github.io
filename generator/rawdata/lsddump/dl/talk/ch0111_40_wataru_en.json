    "ch0111_40_wataru/7101_0701_01_10": "I think the start of something is always nice.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7101_0701_02_10": "A new year, a new day...and new Pokémon\nbattles! I’m so grateful that I can experience\nall these new things!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7102_0701_01_10": "How do you like my outfit today? It really captures\nthe power of Gyarados, doesn’t it?",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7102_0701_02_10": "I also like it because, as a traditional outfit, it’s\na reminder of the ancient customs that have been\npassed down through time!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7103_0701_01_10": "This outfit shows off Gyarados’s power as\na dragon!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7103_0701_02_10": "What’s that, you say? Gyarados isn’t a\nDragon-type Pokémon?",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7103_0701_03_10": "Haha, not all dragons are Dragon-type Pokémon!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7104_0701_01_10": "Whenever I see Gyarados, I remember the Lake\nof Rage in Johto.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7104_0701_02_10": "There was once a red Gyarados raging and\nthrashing about there that had been forced to \nevolve by Team Rocket’s radio waves.",

    "ch0111_40_wataru/7105_0701_02_10": "That teamwork you showed was impressive!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/7105_0701_03_10": "But always remember to stay humble! Whenever a\nnew day starts, remember that!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/1701_0701_01_10": "I’ve been waiting for you! I have something to\ngive you!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/1701_0702_01_10": "You can use it when you’re in trouble. It should\nhelp you out!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2501_0701_01_10": "This outfit is great, but as a dragon master, I\nwant a cape to go with it.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2501_0701_02_10": "I wonder what kind of print and material would\ngo well with this outfit. Do you have any ideas?",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2501_0702_01_10": "I asked my cousin Clair if she had any good\nideas as to where I could find a cape to match\nthis outfit.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2501_0702_02_10": "She said that capes are important...but also that\ntraditional wear has its own unique charm, too!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2501_0702_03_10": "However, I personally prefer wearing a cape.\nI just can’t do without one.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2511_0701_01_10": "Do you go back to your hometown sometimes?",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2511_0701_02_10": "I’m sure there are people there waiting for\nyou to visit—and you might have some\nnostalgic reunions!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2511_0702_01_10": "My hometown is Blackthorn City, in Johto.",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2511_0702_02_10": "It’s surrounded by mountains and can only be\nreached via a treacherous path...",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/2511_0702_03_10": "But that probably wouldn’t be much of a problem\nfor someone like you!",
    "ch0111_40_wataru/3001_0701_01_10": "Pleasant morning we’re having today!\nThe Pokémon are all bright and cheerful.\n",
