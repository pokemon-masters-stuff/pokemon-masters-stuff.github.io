    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0101_0701_02_10": "If there are walls we have to climb\ntoday, let’s climb them together!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0601_0701_01_10": "My Amaura is always on his best\nbehavior, and his skin feels so\nnice and cool to the touch.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0601_0701_02_10": "When I look at his long neck, I feel\na sense of friendship and closeness.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0601_0701_03_10": "I feel like he’s just as eager as I am.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0601_0702_01_10": "I wonder what sort of things Amaura can\nutilize his long neck for. Other than\neating food in high places, that is.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0601_0702_02_10": "I’d love to sit down with him and leisurely\ndebate all of the many possibilities.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0701_01_10": "One time, a chunk of the cliff collapsed\nwhere I was rock-climbing.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0701_02_10": "I actually found a fossil among\nthe stones that fell...",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0701_03_10": "and it turned into a Tyrunt when\nI had it restored at the Fossil Lab.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0701_04_10": "Funnily enough, I found my Amaura’s\nfossil at those very same cliffs.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0702_01_10": "I wonder how I happened to find my\nselfish Tyrunt in the same place I found\nmy sweet Amaura...",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0602_0702_02_10": "Maybe our friendship goes above and\nbeyond the walls of our differences.\n",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0603_0701_01_10": "I get along really well with Siebold,\none of the Elite Four of Kalos, where\nwe’re from.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0603_0701_02_10": "He and I are a lot alike in that we’re\nboth completely devoted to bettering\nourselves and what we do.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0603_0701_03_10": "I’m sure he’s on a deep dive into\nPasio cuisine right now, honing his\nskills as a chef.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0603_0702_01_10": "All this talk about Siebold is making me\nmiss his delicious cooking.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0603_0702_02_10": "I’ll have to ask him to whip me up\nsomething tasty the next time I see him.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0701_01_10": "This might surprise you, but I have\na little bit of a sweet tooth.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0701_02_10": "I’m trying to maintain my current body\nweight, though, so I can’t have\ntoo many sweets.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0701_03_10": "I limit myself to one slice of cake\neach week, but sometimes it’s so\nhard to resist.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0701_04_10": "Then again, that one slice of cake\ntastes even more sublime after a whole\nweek of not eating any.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0702_01_10": "Strictly refraining from doing something\nfor a while makes me even more excited\nto do that thing.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0604_0702_02_10": "I continue to be strict with myself\nso that I can savor that feeling!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0701_01_10": "These stones I use to decorate my\nhair are all the rage back in Kalos.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0701_02_10": "I’m the one who started the\nfashion trend, actually...",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0701_03_10": "Incidentally, that’s how I earned my title as a \ntrendsetter and fashion leader in Kalos.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0701_04_10": "I can be your fashion advisor if you\nlike, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0702_01_10": "These hair stones are unique in the\nsame way that we’re all unique\nas people.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/0605_0702_02_10": "When your clothes and accessories are a\nperfect match for your unique personality—\nthat’s TRUE fashion!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/1701_0701_01_10": "I found something nice for you\nup in the mountains. Here!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/1701_0702_01_10": "You can find a lot of interesting\nthings up in the mountains if you\nknow how to look for them.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/1701_0702_02_10": "That’s one of the things I love\nmost about rock-climbing.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0701_01_10": "Having a daring, adventurous spirit\nis most important of all.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0701_02_10": "When it comes to sports, there’s no\nquestion. But challenging yourself when\nit comes to food is also important!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0701_03_10": "I wonder what sort of flavors Pasio\nhas to offer us...",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0701_04_10": "Now THAT’S an adventure I’d dare to\nget behind!",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0702_01_10": "Competing in the PML is an incredible\nchallenge—a mountain unlike any other\nI’ve climbed before.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0702_02_10": "I wonder what it’ll look like at the\nsummit, towering over all the other\nTrainers. I’d love to see for myself.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2501_0702_03_10": "That is, after I’ve climbed over my\nFIRST wall—defeating you, my friend.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0701_01_10": "You and your Pokémon seem like you\nhave a really close relationship\nwith each other.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0701_02_10": "Relationships with Pokémon can change\njust like relationships with people, though,\ndepending on how dedicated you are.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0701_03_10": "But with someone as dedicated as you,\nI’m sure there’ll never be any issues.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0702_01_10": "There are some things you just can’t reach,\nno matter how far you stretch out your hand.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0702_02_10": "But you never give up—you keep on\nfighting with everything in your heart.\n",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/2511_0702_03_10": "I feel lucky to have found friends that are as \ntalented and spirited as you and your Pokémon.",
    "ch0053_00_zakuro/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning.\nAre you ready for some early training?",
