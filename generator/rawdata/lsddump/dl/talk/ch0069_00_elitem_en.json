    "ch0069_00_elitem/2702_0701_03_10": "He could do it if he tried, but he doesn’t,\nand it’s starting to affect me, too.",
    "ch0069_00_elitem/2702_0702_01_10": "I mean, Slaking’s laziness is really starting to rub\noff on me.",

    "ch0069_00_elitem/2704_0701_02_10": "So then you’re able to use more moves.\nThat’s why speed is so important!",
    "ch0069_00_elitem/2704_0701_03_10": "I’ve been going running with my Pokémon to\nraise my own speed.",
    "ch0069_00_elitem/2704_0701_04_10": "I don’t really feel any different, but, uh... \nI guess I’m a lot healthier!",
    "ch0069_00_elitem/2704_0702_01_10": "Why does your move gauge charge quickly when\nyour Pokémon are fast?",
