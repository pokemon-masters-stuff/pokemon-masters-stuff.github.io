    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_2300_10": "That’s why you went looking for me.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_2400_10": "I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not one of the\nKimono Girls. I’m a fashion designer.",

    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_2600_10": "Hehe. No need to worry. I actually know quite\na bit about Ho-Oh.",

    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3300_10": "Oh, they’re fine! There’s no hard feelings between\nthem or anything like that.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3400_10": "More importantly, let’s get to the part where you\ntell us about Ho-Oh!",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3500_10": "Very well, then.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3600_10": "As I’m sure you’ve heard, Ho-Oh is a beautiful\nPokémon that possesses magnificent,\nseven-colored wings.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3700_10": "It’s said to leave a rainbow in its wake as\nit flies.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3800_10": "It creates a rainbow just by flying... Now that’s\na fitting story for a Legendary Pokémon if I’ve\never heard one.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_3900_10": "There are stories about Dragonair being able to\nchange the weather, but transforming the sky?\nThat seems even more incredible to me.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4000_10": "Ho-Oh is also said to live at the foot of\na rainbow.",

    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_4700_10": "Wow! There’s all kinds of legends about it! I feel\nlike I learned a lot just now!",

    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5000_10": "Ah!",

    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5200_10": "Perhaps it prefers elevated locales? It does fly\nthrough the sky, after all.",
    "legend_event_pm0250_00_houou/5003_1001_5300_10": "Elevated locales... What’s the closest thing to a\ntower here on Pasio? A mountain maybe?",
