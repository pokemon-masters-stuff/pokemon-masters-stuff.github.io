    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0601_0701_03_10": "I’m here to prove that I’m still in my prime when\nit comes to battling!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0601_0702_01_10": "I’d be more excited if that old duff Oak were still\ncompeting, too, though.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0601_0702_02_10": "But enough about me.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0602_0701_01_10": "My Gengar’s mouth is huge.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0602_0701_02_10": "She eats a lot and loves to laugh.\nShe’s a real lively one.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0602_0701_03_10": "She’s gentle and cute. Such a good Pokémon!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0602_0701_04_10": "She does like to make mischief, too, though.",

    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0602_0702_02_10": "For Gengar, being mischievous is just how\nshe plays with me. By now, I’m used to it.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0603_0701_01_10": "Pasio is the place to be right now,\nbut night will fall here, too.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0603_0701_02_10": "Even in the brightest of light, there is always\ndarkness lurking nearby.",

    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0603_0702_02_10": "They can sense a weak heart and will take\nadvantage of it. You must always have a\nstrong heart.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0603_0702_03_10": "Once you’ve grown close to one,\nthere’s no longer anything to be afraid of.",

    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0604_0701_02_10": "They’ll come right down and land on your\nhead and give you playful little bites.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0604_0701_03_10": "If you’re not watching them closely, though,\nthey’ll start to suck your blood, so you have\nto keep an eye on them.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0604_0702_01_10": "For as big as their mouths are,\nGolbat have pretty short fangs.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0604_0702_02_10": "But you still need to be careful around them.\nTheir fangs are thick, so it’s tough to get\nthem out once they’ve sunk them into you.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0604_0702_03_10": "Although that is one of the things I find cute\nabout them.",

    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0605_0701_04_10": "Keep on battling no matter how old you get!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0605_0702_01_10": "That old duff Oak chose to use his talents on\nresearch instead. What a waste!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/0605_0702_02_10": "If you’re a stronger Trainer than other people,\nyou should keep battling as long as you live!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/1701_0701_01_10": "Aha! Great timing—I have something\nfor you.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/1701_0701_02_10": "This is one of my favorite items.\nI’m sure you’ll be able to put it to good use.",

    "ch0061_00_kikuko/1701_0702_02_10": "Like people and items!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0701_01_10": "I’ve been having Pokémon battles for a\nvery long time.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0701_02_10": "I’ve had times when my skills couldn’t cut it.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0701_03_10": "But you can’t give up at times like those!\nYou have to keep battling again and again\nuntil you win!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0701_04_10": "If you give up, you’ll never grow as a Trainer!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0702_01_10": "You’re still so young, and that’s precisely\nwhy you have so many more battles\nahead of you.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0702_02_10": "So take on as many of those battles as you can.\nThat’s the only way you’ll get stronger, child!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2501_0702_03_10": "There’s no doubt about it!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0701_01_10": "When I was young, I was reckless at times,\nand I had the perfect rival.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0701_02_10": "And now I’ve got you youngsters.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0701_03_10": "I wonder how much fun I’ll have against you.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0702_01_10": "The man I accepted as my rival was\nreally strong.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0702_02_10": "And now he’s just some old duff...",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0702_03_10": "Well, at least you’ve got some pluck.\nI don’t think you’ll turn out like him.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/2511_0702_04_10": "You’re not a Trainer if you don’t battle!\nHe really is such a waste of talent...",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning, child.\nMake sure you train hard today!",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3002_0701_01_10": "Did you sleep well last night?\nI hope no wandering Pokémon\ncame by to eat your dreams.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3003_0701_01_10": "Remember—even during the day,\ndarkness is just around the corner.\nDon’t let your guard down.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3004_0701_01_10": "How’s your training going?\nDon’t forget to take a break\nevery now and then.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3005_0701_01_10": "If you’re outside on a dark night, remember to\nwatch your back and never trust your shadow.",
    "ch0061_00_kikuko/3006_0701_01_10": "My Pokémon’s energy always shoots up\nas soon as the sun goes down."
