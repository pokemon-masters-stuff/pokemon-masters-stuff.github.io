    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_1031_03_10": "I don’t understand at all!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0701_01_10": "To establish a bond, I have to... Hi-yah!\nWhew...\nThat’s enough for today!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0701_02_10": "Sorry, I’m trying something out here!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0701_03_10": "When a Trainer and their Pokémon make \na real bond as a sync pair, an amazing \nspecial move will activate...or so I hear!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0701_04_10": "Right now, I’m training to activate it! Hi-yah!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0702_01_10": "Apparently these special moves have \ndifferent effects depending on \nthe sync pair that uses them.",

    "ch0073_00_karate/2701_0702_03_10": "So, the key must be found in training! Hi-yah!",

    "ch0073_00_karate/2702_0701_02_10": "Because we train our offense so much, low\ndefenses are no challenge! Battle us whenever!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2702_0701_03_10": "But an opponent with BIG defenses makes things\ndifficult! That’s our biggest weakness!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2702_0702_01_10": "When you master one thing, another becomes\nyour weakness.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2702_0702_02_10": "And recently, all of the opponents that challenge\nme have had very high defense!",

    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0701_01_10": "I’m going to train in the fiercest of rain or the\nscorchiest of heat!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0701_02_10": "Whoosh whoosh! Pitter-patter!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0701_03_10": "I finally met my idol, the Karate King!\nAnd not only did he battle me—he even\ngave me a Pokémon!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0701_04_10": "I am at the peak of happiness!\nI’d follow him for life!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0701_05_10": "That is...if I hadn’t lost sight of him!\nSo instead, I just started training again.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0702_01_10": "You can train anywhere and anytime!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2703_0702_02_10": "This Pokémon isn’t the only thing I got from the\nKarate King, after all! Life lessons count, too!",

    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0701_01_10": "You, human that uses Pokémon...\nCan you understand my words?",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0701_02_10": "... ... ...",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0701_03_10": "Ha ha ha! I surprised you, didn’t I!\nI was actually in a movie a long time ago!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0701_04_10": "It wasn’t an easy gig for anyone, but the lead\nactor was amazing!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0701_05_10": "The movie didn’t exactly go according to script,\nbut he never gave up and kept redoing his shots.\nI consider him my mentor!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0702_01_10": "I make sure to train as both a Trainer and an\nactor every day!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2704_0702_02_10": "But whenever I’m acting, nobody talks to me!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_1031_01_10": "Come on, now.\nYou’re trying to overcome\nthis, aren’t you?",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_1031_02_10": "I heard about the incident.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_1031_03_10": "It’ll be OK, though!\nDon’t worry about it!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_1032_01_10": "But...my trauma...",

    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_0701_03_10": "A long time ago...when I was still a\nsecurity guard for the gift shop...",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_0701_04_10": "Uh...yeah.\nYou told me that part already.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_0701_05_10": "A frighteningly strong opponent...\nBut it was because of that that I decided to\ntry to reach the top!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_0701_06_10": "Yeah, that’s the ticket! I’ll help you, too!\nYou’ll be fine, buddy!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/2751_0701_07_10": "But I’m still scared of Hyper Beam!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1901_0101_01_10": "I just won a battle, so I’m feeling good!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1901_0501_02_10": "Oh, whatever!\nI’m in a terrible mood now!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1901_0601_01_10": "I think I’m gonna go to bed...",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1901_0601_02_10": "I’m not strong enough to be able to get right\nback up and try again.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1901_0601_03_10": "Uh, well, you know...\nI’m grateful for you battling me!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1902_0101_01_10": "Muahaha! My hobby is to beat Trainers on their\nway to what lies ahead!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1902_0501_01_10": "I can’t believe this!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1902_0601_01_10": "Rather than enjoying defeating someone, should I\naim higher?",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1902_0601_02_10": "It’s probably people with that kind of attitude\nwho gather for the PML.",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1903_0101_01_10": "Err... I wasn’t sleeping! Let’s battle!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1903_0501_02_10": "This can’t be happening!\nThis must be a dream!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1903_0601_01_10": "I was careless, but being half-asleep isn’t\na good enough excuse!",
    "ch0073_00_karate/1903_0601_02_10": "I mean...I wasn’t asleep!\nI swear! It’s not true!"
