    "ch0062_00_karin/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m hoping you’ll do your best to\nentertain me today.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0701_01_10": "My love for Dark-type Pokémon\nfirst began with my Umbreon.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0701_02_10": "His elegant, piercing gaze and beautiful courage\nwon me over immediately.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0701_03_10": "It wasn’t just his looks, though—he can put up\nan incredible fight in a Pokémon battle.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0701_04_10": "Feint Attack, Foul Play, Torment...\nOur tactics must be infuriating for the Pokémon\non the other side of the battlefield.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0701_05_10": "But I love the way so many Dark-type moves\nwork to outwit and counter the opponent.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0702_01_10": "It’s kind of hard to put into words\nwhat it is about Dark-type Pokémon\nthat fascinates me so...",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0601_0702_02_10": "They’re so wild and adorable...\n*sigh*\nWords just don’t do them justice!",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0701_01_10": "I normally spend my days in the Kanto region\nbattling with the eager Trainers who come to\nchallenge the Elite Four.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0701_02_10": "All sorts of Trainers come to test their skills\nagainst me, but my Dark-type Pokémon and I\nusually have them in the palm of our hand.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0701_03_10": "When it comes to tactics, the possibilities are\nendless—depending on your Pokémon’s type,\nmoves, and passive skills.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0701_04_10": "Knowing that your opponent uses Dark types\nisn’t enough. Getting to know your own Pokémon\nand forming a strategy around that is key.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0702_01_10": "A lot of people think that Dark-type Pokémon\ndon’t play fair and square because of the way\ntheir move names sound.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0702_02_10": "But understanding move effects and utilizing\nyour Pokémon’s strengths isn’t something that’s\nunique to Dark types. Not by a long shot!",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0602_0702_03_10": "I hope that you learn something about Dark-type\ntactics when we battle each other.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0701_01_10": "We all know that type matchups can give you a\nhuge advantage in a Pokémon battle...\nbut they’re not always a must.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0701_02_10": "Once, I was challenged by a Trainer who\ninsisted on battling with the first Pokémon they\never received, regardless of type matchups.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0701_03_10": "The first time we battled, I was victorious,\nbut the next time they challenged me, they\nbeat me fair and square.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0701_04_10": "In the end, type matchups may be important,\nbut sometimes victory can be achieved using\nsomething more precious than that.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0702_01_10": "I admire a Trainer who can stand firm\nand stick to their beliefs.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0603_0702_02_10": "It may be a bit self-centered, sure, but it\nmeans they’ve got the power to do\nsomething great. I like that.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0604_0701_01_10": "Hmph... I guess you’re not half bad.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0604_0701_02_10": "Unless my eyes deceive me, I think that\nPokémon of yours is going to be\ngreat someday.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0604_0701_03_10": "Pokémon grow so much stronger when they\nknow their Trainers love them, you see.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0604_0702_01_10": "It’s rare that another Trainer\ncatches my interest.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0604_0702_02_10": "Take that as you will.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0605_0701_01_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ], your Pokémon\nlooks...so very dashing today.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0605_0701_02_10": "You and your Pokémon have the same\nspark in your eye, you know.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0605_0701_03_10": "Remember the way you feel right now,\nand use that positivity to propel you forward.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0605_0702_01_10": "I like to measure up my opponents, then\ntake them down with the perfect counterattack.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/0605_0702_02_10": "It seems like you’ve already found your own\nbattle style as well.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/1701_0701_01_10": "Have you been using your items effectively?\nHere, you can have this.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/1701_0701_02_10": "It’s a present. It’s a, uh... *giggle*\nWell, you’ll see.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/1701_0702_01_10": "How do you like your present?\nI’m sure it’ll come in handy for you.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/1701_0702_02_10": "Knowing how and when to use items\nduring a battle is key.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0701_01_10": "There’s no such thing as a strong Pokémon or\na weak Pokémon, as far as I’m concerned.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0701_02_10": "Every Pokémon is unique in its own way—\nit’s up to the Trainer to figure out how\nbest to utilize that.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0701_03_10": "Any trait can be turned into an advantage\nas long as you love and encourage\nyour Pokémon.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0702_01_10": "Even if some people might call them weak,\nI never give up on the Pokémon I love.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0702_02_10": "It’s precisely because I love them that\nI’m able to see all of the good in them.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2501_0702_03_10": "Then again, I’m sure none of this comes\nas a surprise to you.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0701_01_10": "If you’re someone who gets caught up in the\ndesire to win so much that it drains the fun\nout of battling for you...",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0701_02_10": "sorry, but you’re failing as a Trainer.\nThat sort of mind-set is just not OK.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0701_03_10": "Why, you ask? Because the battles that are\nfun for both you and your Pokémon are the\nones that will lead you to victory.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0702_01_10": "You should always have fun when you’re\nbattling, no matter what.\nSometimes that’s easier said than done...",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0702_02_10": "but I get the feeling that’s not an issue for you.\nI can see that you and your Pokémon have\nmutual trust and affection in spades.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0702_03_10": "Just stay true to yourself and continue to\nhave fun battling just the way you are.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/2511_0702_04_10": "One day, maybe we could face each other\nin a spectacular battle as well—you doing\nwhat you do best and me doing the same.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3001_0701_01_10": "I’m not really a morning person, you know?\nI’m doing my best just to keep my eyes open.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3002_0701_01_10": "It’s not good to sleep in late, you know.\nI suppose that’s your prerogative, though.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3003_0701_01_10": "Have you eaten yet?\nA healthy meal before battle is key.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3004_0701_01_10": "As soon as the clock hits noon,\nmy Pokémon is itching for battle.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3005_0701_01_10": "The starry sky is such a wonder.\nI could gaze up at it all night.",
    "ch0062_00_karin/3006_0701_01_10": "I do love the night...but it’s never good for\na lady to miss her beauty sleep."
