    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_0300_10": "Got it! Let’s go, Torterra!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_0400_10": "All right! How was that?",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_0500_10": "Well, it was a lot of power, but...",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_0301_0600_10": "What’s going on?",

    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_1000_10": "Actually, we’re in the middle of some research on\nsync stones right now.",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_1100_10": "Since the power of sync stones on Pasio seems to\naffect a lot of different things, it’s a fascinating\ntopic to delve into!",

    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2200_10": "Exactly! If you’re not sure about something, we\ncan just test it out!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2300_10": "OK! Thanks!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2400_10": "That positive attitude of yours is always such a big\nhelp, Dawn!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2500_10": "Well, well. You’re doing something interesting.",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2600_10": "If we get our hands on that sync stone research,\nthat’ll be our shortcut to getting stronger!",

    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2800_10": "There’s no way I’m handing it over to you!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_2900_10": "Very well. In that case...",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_3000_10": "You want a battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_3100_10": "What’s that light... A sync move?! How can it be\nso strong?",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_3200_10": "L-let’s get out of here!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_3300_10": "Oh, they’re gone... They just gave up before the\nbattle even started! What a spineless bunch.",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_0301_3400_10": "What was that light just now?",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_0401_3500_10": "Yeah, I was curious about that, too! It was\nbrighter than anything we’ve seen yet!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_0302_3600_10": "She was shining!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_0402_3700_10": "Yeah! That was even brighter than anything we’ve\nseen so far!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_3800_10": "I wonder why?",

    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_4100_10": "Well, there’s no way we were gonna let them get\naway with stealing your research, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_4200_10": "I get it now! That means the bright light we just\nsaw was the result of your bond getting stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_4300_10": "I feel like we’re always thinking more about bonds\nwhenever we hang out with you,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0162_00_koki/2301_1201_4400_10": "Yeah. I’m glad you’re our friend,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
