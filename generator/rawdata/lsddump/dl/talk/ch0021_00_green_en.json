    "ch0021_00_green/0101_0701_02_10": "I’ll battle you, if I have time!\nNot like I’d lose anyway!",
    "ch0021_00_green/0601_0701_01_10": "Have you heard about me already?\nIf you’ve heard I’m super strong, it’s true!",
    "ch0021_00_green/0601_0701_02_10": "I mean, your average Trainer doesn’t even\nstand a chance against me!",

    "ch0021_00_green/0601_0701_04_10": "Well, Red did beat me, but the next time\nwe battle, things are gonna be different!",

    "ch0021_00_green/0602_0701_02_10": "He can even carry me and fly to different towns!",
    "ch0021_00_green/0602_0701_03_10": "My hair does get completely ruined by the\ntime we reach our destination, though.",

    "ch0021_00_green/0603_0701_02_10": "And I’ve got a rival, Red.\nWe can throw everything we’ve got at\neach other, holding nothing back.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0603_0701_03_10": "I hope you can find a rival like that, too.\nOne that will help you grow and vice versa.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0603_0702_01_10": "Red doesn’t say much, but he’s an amazing guy.\nFull of love for Pokémon.",

    "ch0021_00_green/0604_0701_02_10": "I don’t go back much, really.\nI mean, I can get so much stronger!\nI need to keep training!",
    "ch0021_00_green/0604_0701_03_10": "But my sis back home keeps asking when I’m\ncoming home, every time I talk to her.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0604_0701_04_10": "What a bother, right?\nShe doesn’t get that a guy’s gotta do what a\nguy’s gotta do.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0604_0702_01_10": "I guess my sis really doesn’t get that I gotta\ndo what I gotta do.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0604_0702_02_10": "Don’t get me wrong, though. I know she’s just\nlooking out for me, and I’m grateful for that.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0605_0701_01_10": "You know, [Name:PlayerNickname ],\nyou remind me of him. Of my rival.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0605_0701_02_10": "You don’t say much, and the way you look\nwhen you’re with Pokémon...",
    "ch0021_00_green/0605_0701_03_10": "You’re quiet, but you’ve got that burning\npassion, too. Just like him.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0605_0702_01_10": "It’s hard to tell what he’s thinking sometimes,\nyou know.",
    "ch0021_00_green/0605_0702_02_10": "I’ve known him for a long time now, but there\nare still a lot of mysteries about that guy.",
    "ch0021_00_green/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, you can have this.\nIt was tangled up in Pidgeot’s feathers.",
    "ch0021_00_green/1701_0701_02_10": "Put it to good use, OK?",
    "ch0021_00_green/1701_0702_01_10": "Pidgeot can fly at Mach 2!\nYou wouldn’t stand a chance if he hit you!",
    "ch0021_00_green/1701_0702_02_10": "I remember one time, we ran into a flock of\nSwanna. They got super angry, and we had a\nhigh-speed air battle!",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0701_01_10": "You’re aiming to become the \nstrongest Trainer too, right?",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0701_02_10": "I’ve got a word of advice for you, then!",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0701_03_10": "Never forget to treat your Pokémon with\ntrust and love.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0701_04_10": "OK, to be honest, it’s something my gramps\ntaught me a while ago.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0701_05_10": "But I try to live by those words, even today.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0702_01_10": "You can’t become strong just by \nsimply focusing on power.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2501_0702_02_10": "At the end of the day, it’s a trusting relationship\nwith your Pokémon that’ll make a difference.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0701_01_10": "Do you still remember the first Pokémon you\ncaught, or the first opponent you battled?",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0701_02_10": "I definitely remember, even now.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0701_03_10": "How could I forget? It’s the day my adventure\nbegan, after all.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0701_04_10": "And my adventure isn’t over yet.\nNot until my perfect partner and I defeat Red,\nand I become the most powerful Trainer ever!",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0701_05_10": "Shoot, I don’t even have enough time\nto catch my breath!",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0702_01_10": "Maybe you’ll become a Trainer like Red,\ntoo, someday.",
    "ch0021_00_green/2511_0702_02_10": "When the time comes,\nI know I’ll be super pumped!",
    "ch0021_00_green/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! All pumped up and ready for the day?\nDon’t let your guard down \njust because it’s early!",
    "ch0021_00_green/3002_0701_01_10": "Good morning. How you feeling?\nMe? I’m feeling great. Thanks for asking!",
    "ch0021_00_green/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey, how’s it going?\nYou’re not slacking off on your training, are ya?",
    "ch0021_00_green/3004_0701_01_10": "Bonjour! Off for an adventure?\nThat’s fine and all, but don’t forget to have\na battle with me from time to time!",
    "ch0021_00_green/3005_0701_01_10": "Fancy running into you at this hour! Taking a\nbreak is an important part of training, you know.",
    "ch0021_00_green/3006_0701_01_10": "You’re still adventuring at this hour?\nI think I’m gonna call it a day myself.\nSmell ya later!"
