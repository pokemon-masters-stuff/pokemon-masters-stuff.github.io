    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_0300_10": "That feeling of waiting year after year after year,\nwithout any guarantee of meeting again...",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0301_0400_10": "Were you waiting long?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0401_0500_10": "Oh! I wasn’t actually talking about me...\nWhile I was waiting for you, I suddenly\nremembered this person I used to know.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0302_0600_10": "Uh... Are you OK?",

    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_0900_10": "He’d been separated from his partner Pokémon\nlong, long ago, and he had been searching for it\never since.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1000_10": "For three thousand years, he looked for his\nPokémon. I know—it sounds absurd.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1100_10": "But it got me thinking. What would I do if you\ndidn’t show up for three thousand years?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1200_10": "*sigh*\nYeah, I’d probably go home.\nI’d wait for about 30 minutes and then go home.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1300_10": "If it were Serena, she wouldn’t even wait\nthree minutes.",

    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1500_10": "I couldn’t do that. I know I would lose heart.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1600_10": "I care for Espurr a lot, but if I were asked if I\ncare for him that much? Well, it makes me think.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_1700_10": "How about you?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0301_1800_10": "Three thousand years?\nSure, I could do that.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0401_1900_10": "Seriously? You even said it so easily.\nYou really are something special.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0302_2000_10": "Probably not.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0402_2100_10": "Yeah, I mean, three thousand years...\nHow many lifetimes is that?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2200_10": "“When the ice and snow melt, spring arrives...\nYou and your Pokémon will be together \nfor many years to come.”",

    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2400_10": "But I wonder, if you spend that much time with\nyour Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2500_10": "would you be more willing to wait three\nthousand years for them?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2600_10": "I don’t know. I guess there’s not even much of\na point in thinking about it, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2700_10": "What do you think, Espurr?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2800_10": "... ... ...",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_2900_10": "You’ve been using your psychic powers for the\nlast few minutes, haven’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_3000_10": "You in a good mood or something?\nWhat have you been getting up to over there?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1101_3000_20": "With a twinkle in his eye, Espurr gave Calem\na flower he had been levitating with his\npsychic powers.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_3100_10": "Hm? A flower?\nThat’s a pretty shade of purple.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_3200_10": "Have you been making this flower levitate for me\nthis whole time?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0301_3300_10": "That’s impressive psychic power!",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0401_3400_10": "He can hold it longer or shorter depending on\nthe day.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0401_3500_10": "Today looks like his record time!",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0302_3600_10": "That’s some endurance!",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0402_3700_10": "Yeah, I think Espurr is a bit more on the\nresilient side.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0402_3800_10": "Although whenever I get one of his favorite\nPoké Puffs, he does get a little antsy.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_3900_10": "Sorry for making you wait, Espurr.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4000_10": "You really are a trooper, aren’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0301_4100_10": "Do you understand him?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0401_4200_10": "He said that it’s fine because he likes waiting.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0302_4300_10": "Did you catch that?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_0402_4400_10": "He said that it’s fine because he likes waiting.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4500_10": "I get the feeling that I understood what he was\ntrying to say...although I don’t know if I was\neven close.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4600_10": "Sorry I said earlier that I probably wouldn’t look\nfor you for three thousand years.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4700_10": "I’m your Trainer—I won’t ever make you wait\nthat long.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4800_10": "But if we were to ever get separated...",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_4900_10": "Yeah, I’d look for you. Three thousand years,\nten thousand years—it doesn’t matter. I’ll look\nfor you no matter how long it takes.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2301_1201_5000_10": "I swear on this flower.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_1201_0100_10": "So you wanna battle old Nanu, huh? You\nsure you’ve thought this through?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_1201_0200_10": "I still want to to get stronger—strong enough that\nI can always take care of my Espurr!",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_1201_0300_10": "Are you really ready for this?\nI’m not going to go easy on you.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0101_0100_10": "Well, I guess it’s time to find out who’s stronger.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0501_0100_10": "Heh, you’re pretty strong, aren’t you, kid?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0501_0200_10": "We did it, Espurr! But...what’s happening to you?",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0501_0300_10": "Looks like your partner’s evolving.\nI guess congratulations are in order.",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0501_0400_10": "Whoa, this is awesome, Espurr!\nWe’re getting stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0003_00_calme/2311_0501_0500_10": "Let’s stick together and become the greatest\nsync pair of them all!"
