    "ch0060_00_anzu/0601_0701_01_10": "People in Kanto say that Weezing are Pokémon\nthat eat poison gas and get bigger.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0601_0701_02_10": "And would you believe that they are really\npopular among girls?",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0601_0701_03_10": "Yeah, I figured you wouldn’t.\nI might be the only girl that does like them.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0601_0702_01_10": "I love my Weezing.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0601_0702_02_10": "I might sometimes make him angry and make him\nexplode, though.",

    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0701_02_10": "Father is very strong and strict. He is also cool\nwith how skilled of a Pokémon Trainer he is!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0701_03_10": "But more importantly, he’s kind!\nIsn’t he awesome?",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0701_04_10": "But I won’t lose in the PML!\nI’m still a Pokémon Trainer first and foremost\nand a daughter second!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0702_01_10": "Overcoming the person you admire the most is\nthe ultimate form of flattery!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0702_02_10": "So I was hoping that I could battle you a lot.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0602_0702_03_10": "That way, we can polish each other’s skills!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0603_0701_01_10": "Everybody in the Fuchsia City Gym disguises\nthemselves to look like me!\nYou can imagine how hard it is to find me!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0603_0701_02_10": "It’s really fun, and a lot of the challengers\nhave good things to say about it, but...",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0603_0701_03_10": "nobody realizes it’s me if I ever dress up.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0603_0702_01_10": "There are a lot of fashionable people on Pasio.",

    "ch0060_00_anzu/0603_0702_03_10": "I mean...that’s not really my intention.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0604_0701_01_10": "My ninja uniform is specially tailored! It’s made\nfrom Ariados silk!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0604_0701_02_10": "It’s really durable! And even better, it’s warm\nin the winter and really cool in the summer!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0604_0701_03_10": "But the best part is that it makes me feel as if\nAriados is always protecting me.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0604_0702_01_10": "People sometimes make gloves or scarves with\nAriados silk, too.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0604_0702_02_10": "Maybe I can make you some!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nWhat do you think of Poison-type Pokémon?",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0701_02_10": "I think it’s great that each Pokémon has moves\nthat it alone specializes in.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0701_03_10": "And they use those moves to get any advantage\nthey can and become stronger, whether their\ntype is Fire, Grass, Water, or even Poison.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0701_04_10": "Of course, Poison isn’t one of the popular types,\nbut I’m not ashamed to say that I like it.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0702_01_10": "You can ask me anything about Poison types!\nI’ll teach you everything I know!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/0605_0702_02_10": "I’m learning a lot about moves from you,\ntoo, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nIt’s nice to be able to exchange knowledge.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, you can have this!\nIt was caught in Ariados’s thread!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/1701_0701_02_10": "Whether it’s a Pokémon or an item,\nthere’s always a right place to use it!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/1701_0702_01_10": "You can find a lot of cool stuff caught in\nAriados’s web. Isn’t that cool?",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/1701_0702_02_10": "When I was a kid, I was clumsy and would get\ncaught in Ariados’s web myself.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0701_01_10": "My father is a member of the Elite Four!\nHe’s one of the best Pokémon Trainers \nin the world!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0701_02_10": "I inherited my Gym from my father!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0701_03_10": "I still have a lot to learn, but one day, I’m going\nto become so strong that both my father and all\nthe other Gym Leaders will acknowledge me!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0702_01_10": "I want to become stronger so that I’ll be a\nbetter Gym Leader!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0702_02_10": "I have to study more about poison and practice\nmy ninja techniques...\nThere are a lot of things I have to do!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2501_0702_03_10": "I’m going to be challenging you to battles a lot\nmore in the future, so be ready for that!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0701_01_10": "I’m not one to brag, but I think I’m pretty strong!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0701_02_10": "Of course, I still have a lot to learn, and I’m not\nnearly strong enough for my father to accept me.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0701_03_10": "But as long as I’m with you, \nI know I can surpass all my limits!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0702_01_10": "I apparently have a little bit of stage fright.",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0702_02_10": "But whenever I’m talking to you,\nI can relax and use my full strength!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/2511_0702_03_10": "So let’s stick together!\nI don’t think I can do this without you!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! I always start my day with a long jog\nto help strengthen my legs!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/3002_0701_01_10": "Life is full of distractions, but I’m gonna do my\nbest to stay focused on my training today!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/3003_0701_01_10": "If I ever want to beat you or my father,\nI’ve gotta train hard every day!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/3004_0701_01_10": "I was just on my way to give\nmy father his lunch!",
    "ch0060_00_anzu/3005_0701_01_10": "If your eyes aren’t used to the dark,\nI can guide you at night.",
