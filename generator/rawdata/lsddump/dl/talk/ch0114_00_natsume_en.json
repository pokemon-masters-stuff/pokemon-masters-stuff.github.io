    "ch0114_00_natsume/0601_0701_01_10": "A lot of people think my psychic powers are\njust part of my everyday life.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0601_0701_02_10": "But it’s not that simple.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0601_0701_03_10": "Honestly, it’s very difficult to control my powers.\nI can lose the sense for it quite easily if I don’t\ntrain every day.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0601_0701_04_10": "I guess it’s similar to Pokémon battles.\nBoth require daily training.",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/0601_0702_02_10": "And I’m not only talking about psychic powers.",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/0602_0701_02_10": "However, he never tells me the answer whenever\nI’m struggling with something.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0602_0701_03_10": "He must know that in those cases, staying silent\nis the best thing to do.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0602_0701_04_10": "Because if we don’t find our own answers to\nour problems, we’ll never grow.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0602_0702_01_10": "Alakazam is very smart and has powerful\npsychic abilities.",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/0603_0702_02_10": "That’s probably because you’re filled with so many\ndifferent possibilities.",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/0604_0701_02_10": "I ultimately won, but they were very\nstrong opponents.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0604_0701_03_10": "I even saw a glimpse of a future where I\nwould lose.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0604_0702_01_10": "I rarely initiate a battle.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0604_0702_02_10": "But there are times, like with the Fighting Dojo,\nwhere I can’t avoid a conflict.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0604_0702_03_10": "I’ve long since accepted this as the fate of a\nGym Leader.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0605_0701_01_10": "I had a feeling when I first met you, \n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/0605_0702_02_10": "For example, let’s see...\nAh yes, like going shopping.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/0605_0702_03_10": "Yeah... That would be a lot of fun.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/1701_0701_01_10": "I thought I’d run into you if I waited here.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/1701_0701_02_10": "Here, I wanted to give this to you.\nI know you’ll find a use for it.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/1701_0702_01_10": "Do you like it?",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/1701_0702_02_10": "I knew you would. I saw a future where you\nwere happy.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0701_01_10": "People seem to think that psychic powers are\nsomething that only a few people have, but\nthat’s not true. Everybody has psychic power.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0701_02_10": "People just don’t realize it.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0701_03_10": "I don’t just mean physical things you can see, like\nmoving an object or something.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0701_04_10": "Consider the power created by the love you have\nfor your Pokémon. I think that can be considered\na psychic power.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0702_01_10": "Psychic powers are a lot more commonplace than\nmany might think.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2501_0702_02_10": "I just hope I can make people here on Pasio\nunderstand that.",

    "ch0114_00_natsume/2511_0701_03_10": "we can also share emotions. So when Alakazam\nis sad, I get sad, too.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2511_0701_04_10": "Alakazam and I have been through a lot. You\nmight even call us comrades-in-arms.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2511_0702_01_10": "Feeling your Pokémon’s pain like your own can\nbe tough.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2511_0702_02_10": "But at the same time, maybe that’s actually a good\nthing when we look at it as Trainers.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/2511_0702_03_10": "After all, the more you share your feelings with\nyour Pokémon, the closer you will become.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/3001_0701_01_10": "Are you able to sense what sort of day lies\nahead of you? Sometimes knowing can be a\ndouble-edged sword.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/3002_0701_01_10": "Hmm... It seems as though neither your heart\nnor your mind are fully awake this morning.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/3003_0701_01_10": "Let’s visit the ocean today. Something important\nawaits us there... I can feel it.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/3004_0701_01_10": "We’ll have a good time if we spend the day\ntogether... I don’t need to see the future to\nknow that much.",
    "ch0114_00_natsume/3005_0701_01_10": "We’ll see each other again tomorrow...\nI’ve already foreseen it.",
