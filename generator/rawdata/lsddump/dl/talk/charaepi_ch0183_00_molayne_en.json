    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_1500_10": "Pasio and Alola have very different skies, each\nwith their own unique data set that I can record.\nIt’s why I never get tired of watching the stars!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_1600_10": "Ah, but don’t worry. I do get regular sleep more\noften than not.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_1700_10": "But there are times when I think I’m on the verge\nof discovering something truly amazing, only to\nlose track of the time altogether.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_1800_10": "That’s why I yawned earlier and why Dugtrio took\noff and left me behind.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_1900_10": "Haha, looks like they’re at it again.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2000_10": "Dugtrio’s heads often compete with each other to\nsee which of them has the best metal whiskers.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2100_10": "Now let’s see...",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2200_10": "Yes, yes! You have a very original hairstyle!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2300_10": "Your whiskers are large and elegant!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2400_10": "Oh! Your whiskers are looking just as soft and\nstylish as ever!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_2500_10": "Hmm... Dugtrio usually calms down after I\ncompliment his three heads.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0301_2600_10": "They look the same to me.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0401_2700_10": "No, no, they’re quite different. They each have\ntheir own distinct charm.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0302_2800_10": "What’s different about them?",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0402_2900_10": "I suppose it’s not immediately obvious. You’ve got\nto look closely to see their differences.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3000_10": "After spending every day with Dugtrio, you start\nto notice what makes each head so unique.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3100_10": "The same could also be said of the stars in the\nsky. They look the same at first glance, but they’re\nactually quite different.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3200_10": "Different things coming together to create new and\nbeautiful landscapes.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3300_10": "That’s how I think of Dugtrio, too. Each head is\nunique in its own way, but they come together to\ncreate a force to be reckoned with!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0301_3400_10": "Like a team on Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0401_3500_10": "Hmm, I suppose you’re right! From three sync\npairs, we create a single team!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0302_3600_10": "Like a battle using sync pairs!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0402_3700_10": "Right! Each sync pair is different, but together\nthey create a power that’s greater than the sum\nof its parts!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3800_10": "We could all learn from Dugtrio and work on our\nteamwork.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_3900_10": "Oh? Looks like Dugtrio’s heads have calmed down.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_4000_10": "I guess the worst of their whisker argument has\npassed... *yawn*",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0301_4100_10": "You need to get some rest!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0401_4200_10": "Ahaha... I suppose you’re right. I should go catch\na few z’s.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0302_4300_10": "Looks like you need a nap break!",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_0402_4400_10": "Ahaha... I suppose you’re right. I should go get\nsome rest.",
    "charaepi_ch0183_00_molayne/2301_1201_4500_10": "After I’m good and rested, you’ll join me for some\ntraining, right? I’d be glad if you did!"
