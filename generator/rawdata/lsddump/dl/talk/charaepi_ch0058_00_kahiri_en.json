    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_0600_10": "But I go to the forest so that \nI can at least practice my swing.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_0700_10": "Toucannon often goes out with a golf ball\nin his mouth, so I guess we lost this one\nwhen we were in the forest last time.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_0800_10": "I practice my swing six hours every day.\nIt has become a fundamental routine for me.",

    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_2200_10": "It’s so cozy next to his beak, \nand touching it helps me fall asleep.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_2300_10": "See? If you get close like this...",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_2400_10": "Hmmm...\nHe doesn’t seem to be in a mood to humor me.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_2500_10": "Is this because of what happened yesterday?",

    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3000_10": "There were many onlookers who wanted to\nchallenge me, one after another.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3100_10": "In the end, we had 20 Pokémon \nbattles back-to-back.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3200_10": "We were exhausted by the end of the day,\nand I just collapsed next to Toucannon.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3300_10": "I meant to snuggle close to his beak, \nbut I ended up sticking my head into it \nand falling asleep there.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3400_10": "Toucannon stayed in that awkward position \nall night and waited for me to wake up.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3500_10": "I’m sure the poor thing was trying \nhard not to wake me.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3600_10": "By morning, his beak was trembling \nfrom the strain.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3700_10": "Do you think my head was heavy?",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3800_10": "Ow, ow! Toucannon! Stop! Stop pecking!\nYour beak is so hot!\nWhat does this rhythm mean... Are you angry?",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_3900_10": "My Toucannon is usually shy, but he becomes\nvery stern when he’s angry.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_4000_10": "I guess this is just him showing how much he\ncares. I’m sorry, Toucannon. I’ll make sure to\nnot let myself doze off like that again.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0301_4100_10": "How can you work so hard like that?",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0401_4200_10": "I suppose it’s because it’s something I enjoy.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0302_4300_10": "Don’t you ever just take a break?",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0402_4400_10": "That’s a good question...\nThat thought hasn’t really crossed my mind.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_4500_10": "I was fortunate enough to find \ntwo things that I love.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_4600_10": "And those are Toucannon and golf.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_4700_10": "It would be wrong for me to say that\neither of those is a burden to me.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0301_4800_10": "Don’t push yourself too much.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0401_4900_10": "You don’t need to worry about that with me!",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0302_5000_10": "Don’t overdo it, all right?",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_0402_5100_10": "You don’t need to worry about that with me!",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_5200_10": "If I go so far that I might really hurt myself,\nToucannon will be there to peck some sense \nback into me.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_5300_10": "He is the perfect partner when it comes to golf,\nPokémon battles, and even everyday life.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_5400_10": "If I overwork myself and collapse, \nit would cause a lot of trouble for Toucannon.",
    "charaepi_ch0058_00_kahiri/2301_1201_5500_10": "And that is something I want to avoid \nmore than anything."
