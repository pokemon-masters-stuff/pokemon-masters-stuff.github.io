    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0101_0701_02_10": "Don’t push yourself too hard, all right?",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0601_0701_01_10": "I’m a cop in Alola.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0601_0701_02_10": "But Alola’s a really peaceful place.\nThanks to that, I get to take it easy.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0601_0701_03_10": "Even though there are plenty of things going\non around the world.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0601_0702_01_10": "The police mascot for Alola is a Granbull.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0601_0702_02_10": "I personally think a Meowth wouldn’t be too\nbad, either.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0602_0701_01_10": "Compared to other places, Alola has some\nfunny-looking Pokémon.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0602_0701_02_10": "Even my Persian looks different from the ones\nyou’re used to, doesn’t she?",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0602_0701_03_10": "Alolan Persian have nice round faces.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0602_0702_01_10": "I know that Alolan Persian are\nrare around these parts.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0602_0702_02_10": "I like both Alolan and normal versions, but I\npersonally prefer the fluffier Alolan ones.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0603_0701_01_10": "You know the Pokémon Honchkrow\nand Krookodile?",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0603_0701_02_10": "They’ve got some scary looking mugs, but\nyou wouldn’t think so if you saw them smile.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0603_0701_03_10": "You can never know anything about a person or\na Pokémon just from a glance. When you have\na chance, take a good look at those around you.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0603_0702_01_10": "What?",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0603_0702_02_10": "You won’t get anything out of gazing at me.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0604_0701_01_10": "Pasio is nice and all, but I’m not really used to\nbeing far from home.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0604_0701_02_10": "What sights to see, what food to eat...\nI have no idea what to do.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0604_0701_03_10": "In the end, I slack off just like I do in Alola.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0604_0702_01_10": "Things never changing is definitely a source\nof comfort...even if it does get boring.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...\nNo, it’s nothing too important.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0701_02_10": "I noticed that Pasio doesn’t have a\nSushi High Roller around.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0701_03_10": "I wanted their Z-Kaiseki Ronin Set,\nbut I guess there’s nothing I can do.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0701_04_10": "If you ever find yourself in Alola,\nI’ll treat you to it.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0702_01_10": "I heard that Kalos has a Sushi High Roller.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/0605_0702_02_10": "But apparently they’re a little different from the\none in Alola.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/1701_0701_01_10": "Hold out your hand.\nHere, you can have this.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/1701_0701_02_10": "Whether it’s of use or not is up to you, though.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/1701_0702_01_10": "No point in a guy like me hanging on to\nsomething like that.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/1701_0702_02_10": "But you’re different. If I find any again,\nI’ll make sure to give them to you.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0701_01_10": "Uh...",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0701_02_10": "If you need anything, let me know.\nI can at least hear you out.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0701_03_10": "You look like you have a lot on your plate.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0701_04_10": "You might even have stuff that you can’t do\nall by yourself.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0702_01_10": "You’ll tire yourself out if you’re always in\na rush.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2501_0702_02_10": "Taking it easy isn’t as bad a thing as people\nmight tell you.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2511_0701_01_10": "You’re getting really strong...\nWhat are you planning for the future?",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2511_0701_02_10": "Trying to get even stronger is fine, too...\nBut that’s a really long path.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2511_0701_03_10": "But seeing how steadfast you are... It makes\nme think you just might be able to make it.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2511_0702_01_10": "I’m an old man.\nI try not to have dreams anymore.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/2511_0702_02_10": "As long as young kids like you enjoy yourselves,\nthat’s all I can ask for.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3001_0701_01_10": "Out for Pokémon battles this early, huh?\nMe? I’m just loafing around, I guess.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3002_0701_01_10": "You’re out and about pretty early. If you’ve got\nsomething to do, better go get it sorted.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3003_0701_01_10": "Hmm, already midday. You can train as hard as\nyou like, but don’t overdo it.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3004_0701_01_10": "Hey there. If you’re up for Pokémon battles,\ndo them while it’s still light out.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3005_0701_01_10": "Careful now. The paths around here can be hard\nto see at night. I guess you’ll be fine with your\nPokémon, though.",
    "ch0056_00_kuchinashi/3006_0701_01_10": "It’s already pretty late.\nOnce you’re done with whatever you’re doing,\nyou should head home and get some sleep."
