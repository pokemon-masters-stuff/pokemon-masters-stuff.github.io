    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0200_10": "Hiiiiii, people of Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0300_10": "I’m Lisia! I came here all the way from Hoenn with\nmy Altaria, Ali, to have a good time!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0400_10": "Now, without further ado, let’s get this show on\nthe road!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0500_10": "Hi there! You wouldn’t happen to be interested in\ncontests, would you?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0600_10": "Oh! [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0700_10": "I’m sorry! I was so focused on scouting that I\ndidn’t even notice you there!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0800_10": "But wait...now that I think about it, you may be\njust the sync pair I’ve been searching for.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_0900_10": "Let’s get right to it, then! Lisia’s...Miraculous...\nContest Scouting!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0301_1000_10": "Contest what?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_1100_10": "Oh, that’s right! I guess there are a lot of people\nhere on Pasio who don’t know about contests!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0302_1200_10": "Sorry, what kind of scouting?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_1300_10": "Oh, that’s right! I guess there are a lot of people\nhere on Pasio who don’t know about contests!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_1400_10": "There’s so much more to Pokémon than just battles!\nThe Pokémon Contest Spectacular is a chance to\nshow off the real appeal of your Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_1500_10": "How about it? Have I got you interested? Do you\nthink you’d like to try your hand in a contest?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0301_1600_10": "Yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_1700_10": "I knew you’d say that!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0302_1800_10": "I don’t know!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_1900_10": "An honest answer! I’ll take it!\nDon’t you worry—I’ll win you over! Just you wait!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2000_10": "I’m actually rehearsing right now for a program\nthat’s going to be aired here on Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2100_10": "We’re doing it to try to get the word out to the\npeople here about the contests of Hoenn.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2200_10": "I’d love it if I could find some new contest idols\nhere, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2300_10": "And of course, I’d love to come up with a contest\nto hold here for all the people I scout to\nparticipate in!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2400_10": "There are so many wonderful people here on\nPasio, though. I just can’t decide who to scout.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0301_2500_10": "Why not just scout everyone?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_2600_10": "Whoa! That’s a really bold idea! But I think it might\njust be a good one!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0302_2700_10": "There ARE lots of great people here.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_2800_10": "Right? Maybe I should just scout everyone here!\nHaha. Just kidding! Unless...",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_2900_10": "Ah, but since I’ve come all the way here to Pasio,\nI feel like I might as well try my best to win the\nPML, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_3000_10": "Ali and I worked hard to make our way to the top\nin contests.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_3100_10": "With our teamwork, I’m sure we can work our\nway to the top in Pokémon battles, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0301_3200_10": "Do you not really like battles?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_3300_10": "I just don’t have the same confidence in battles as\nI do in contests...",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_3400_10": "I can’t focus on winning during battles. I always\nend up getting distracted by just how cute the\nPokémon are.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_3500_10": "But I think that’s exactly why trying my best in the\nPML will help me during contests as well.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0302_3600_10": "Isn’t it a lot of work to do both?",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_3700_10": "Don’t worry about me. I’m good at working hard!\nI didn’t know the first thing about contests when I\nfirst started them, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_3800_10": "But I did a bunch of superhard training with Ali,\nand now look at us! We’re contest idols!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_3900_10": "Contests used to be the only thing I was\ninterested in.",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4000_10": "But I found out that doing a bunch of other stuff\nwith my Pokémon is a good way to bring out their\nappeal, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4100_10": "Working on my Pokédex, challenging\nGym Leaders... It all helps!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4200_10": "This one Trainer I met a while back taught me\nthat, and I’ve been working hard at everything\nI do ever since!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0301_4300_10": "That makes sense!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0401_4400_10": "Yeah! I’m glad you understand!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0302_4500_10": "That’s great!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_0402_4600_10": "Hehehe. Thank you!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4700_10": "So I consider you both a friend and a rival,\nyou know!",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4800_10": "“Sprint Toward Your Dreams! Dream Challenger!”",
    "charaepi_ch0215_00_lutia/2301_1201_4900_10": "We’re both aiming to win the tournament, but\nlet’s stay friends all the way to the top!"
