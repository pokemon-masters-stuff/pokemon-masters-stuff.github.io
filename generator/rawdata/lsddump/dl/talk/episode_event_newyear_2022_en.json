    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_0500_10": "Let’s sync up and snag ourselves a win!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_0600_10": "Yes. I’m sure we’ll get used to battling together,\nlittle by little.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_0700_10": "Also...it’d be a shame to lose while wearing such\nfestive outfits.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_0800_10": "Are you ready? Here we go!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_0900_10": "They sure are tough! Looks like they’ve had a few\nbattles together to work on their teamwork!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1000_10": "How many wins do you have so far?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1100_10": "Five!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1200_10": "And we plan to add one more with this battle!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1300_10": "Yeah! Sorry, but we’re gonna win!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1400_10": "Don’t think you’ll take us out that easily!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1500_10": "We’re just getting warmed up!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1600_10": "We were so close! But we let victory slip right\nthrough our fingers...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1700_10": "That was an excellent battle. Thank you!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1800_10": "It seems our opponents may have been a bit worn\nout from their previous matches.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_1900_10": "Yeah. If we’d taken one more hit, we probably\nwould’ve lost.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2000_10": "Your support really helped me out!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2100_10": "It was like you could tell beforehand what I was\ngoing to do. Is that your precognition at work?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2200_10": "Yes, it is.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2300_10": "You’re usually a quiet person, but when you\nstart to enjoy yourself in battle, you get\nvery passionate.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2400_10": "That’s why I tried to make sure I battled in a way\nthat would help foster that passion.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2500_10": "You sure know your stuff! Let’s keep battling and\nstart a winning streak, shall we?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1001_2600_10": "Sure. Let’s aim for a cleaner win next time.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1101_2700_20": "After that, Volkner and Sabrina battled against\nmany sync pairs...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4003_1101_2800_20": "and steadily increased their winning streak.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0100_10": "We’re doing a great job of keeping our winning\nstreak going!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0200_10": "I can’t wait to see what other combinations we\ncan pull off with your precognition!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0300_10": "We might just be a good team after all!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0400_10": "That may be so.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0500_10": "Hey, you two!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0600_10": "Come battle us next!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0700_10": "Yeah! We’ll show you our awesome teamwork!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0800_10": "So you joined the tournament, too?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_0900_10": "Of course! It’s the perfect opportunity to challenge\nyou to a rematch!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1000_10": "Let us see how hot your spirit burns!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1100_10": "Don’t let your guard down, Sabrina.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1200_10": "This team is gonna be hard to beat!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1300_10": "I have no intention of letting up. We will put our\nall into this battle.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1400_10": "What just happened?! We lost?!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1500_10": "... ... ...\n... ... ...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1600_10": "Whew... We lost again...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1700_10": "Hahaha! Sorry about that, you two!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4004_1001_1800_10": "It’s our win! Looks like we’re starting off this year\non the right foot!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0100_10": "So these two are our next opponents.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0200_10": "I feel like I’ve seen that masked Trainer\nsomewhere before...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0300_10": "Hey hey, what’re you doing, getting pensive when\na battle’s about to start?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0400_10": "You can’t beat us if your mind’s on other things!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0500_10": "Oh...I guess you’re right.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0600_10": "Now’s not the time to be thinking about anything\nother than battling!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0700_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0800_10": "Hm...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_0900_10": "Let’s get ready to rumble!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1000_10": "I heard your team uses some interesting tactics,\nso I’ve been looking forward to this!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1100_10": "Show us the strength you’ve forged by winning\nyour matches up till now!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1200_10": "Amazing! Such power!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1300_10": "Look who’s talking! You’re shockingly strong!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1400_10": "That said, we’re the ones who’re gonna win here!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1500_10": "There’s no way we’ll lose!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1600_10": "Extreme conditions really test you and train you!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1700_10": "Let’s see who comes out on top!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1800_10": "Hold the battle!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_1900_10": "What’s the matter? Things were just getting good.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2000_10": "The system that generates Pasio’s energy just\nshort-circuited! Certain parts of the island are\nexperiencing power outages.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2100_10": "The generator shorted? That’s not good...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2200_10": "You didn’t have a hand in this, did you?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2300_10": "C’mon, don’t look at me like that!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2400_10": "I was just battling, so there’s no way I could’ve\ndone anything.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2500_10": "I suppose you’re right. But if it wasn’t you, why\ndid this happen?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2600_10": "Could that be the source of our problem?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2700_10": "Why don’t we postpone this battle for now?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2800_10": "We should probably resolve any issues with that\ngenerator first, if it’s broken.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_2900_10": "Yes, agreed.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_3000_10": "Yeah, I got you. I’ll go check if there have been\nany accidents because of the power outages!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_3100_10": "I’m planning on checking out the area where we\nsaw that bright flash of light just now. Want to\ncome with?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_3200_10": "Of course. We are a team, after all.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4005_1001_3300_10": "Thanks! Then let’s head out!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0100_10": "Oh, these Pokémon...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0200_10": "I see. Their electrical discharge must be why the\npower generator shorted!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0300_10": "What should we do?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0400_10": "Let’s work together and try to calm those\nPokémon down.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0500_10": "Raichu are usually gentle, but they turn aggressive\nif they have too much electricity in their bodies.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0600_10": "I’m sure those Magnemite are also being affected\nby Raichu, too.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0700_10": "We can have a Pokémon battle to make them\ndischarge all that electricity!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0800_10": "That makes sense. I suppose you’d know best,\nbeing an Electric-type Gym Leader.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_0900_10": "Let’s show them our teamwork that we built up\nduring the New Year’s Battle Tournament!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4006_1001_1000_10": "Yes, let’s!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0100_10": "Phew... Still not done yet?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0200_10": "We got them to discharge a lot of energy by\nbattling them...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0300_10": "But it looks like they’re still a bit on edge. Maybe\nit’s because we cornered them.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0400_10": "This might take a while...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0500_10": "Understood. Let me help.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0600_10": "Watch out! It’s dangerous to get too close!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0700_10": "It’s OK. There’s nothing to be afraid of.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0800_10": "What was that?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_0900_10": "If we’ve gotten them to discharge most of their\nenergy, all we have to do is calm them down.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1000_10": "Whenever I hear Chingling’s bell, it soothes my\nsoul... So I figured it would work here, too.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1100_10": "Oh, that makes sense. You had me worried for\na second!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1200_10": "Now all that’s left is to return these Pokémon\nto their Trainers.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1300_10": "Thank you, Chingling. You did well.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1400_10": "I think this was the dangerous event I foresaw.\nI’m glad we were able to put an end to that.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1500_10": "I see you’ve taken care of things here!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1600_10": "Professor Kukui!",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1800_10": "The Trainers of those Pokémon will be here soon.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_1900_10": "Hmm... The Pokémon seem to have calmed\ndown. Looks like their heart rates are back to\nnormal, too.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2000_10": "I imagine the lightning that struck last night was\nthe reason they were so worked up.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2100_10": "The air around them was charged with electricity,\nand they probably took in too much of it.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2200_10": "My guess is when they tried to discharge it,\nit caused the power generator to short-circuit.",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2700_10": "Electivire’s electrical energy output is one of the\nbest of all Electric-type Pokémon. Wild as it may\nsound, he may have changed the weather.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2800_10": "Well, that’s Electivire for you! I guess that\nhappens sometimes!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_2900_10": "So you were the cause of this after all!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3000_10": "Whatever! You already solved the problem.\nNow, we just have to repair the power-\ngenerating system!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3100_10": "It’ll probably take some time to repair that, right?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3200_10": "Yes, and it’s bound to be troublesome.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3300_10": "Since we may have played a part in causing all\nof this, how about we help you fix it?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3400_10": "You just want to tinker with the machines,\ndon’t you!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3500_10": "Haha! You saw right through me!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3600_10": "I’ve been curious about how Pasio’s power\nsystem was set up!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4007_1001_3700_10": "Goodness.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0100_10": "I know we’ve solved the first problem...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0200_10": "But I really am still concerned about that\npower generator...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0300_10": "You’re still going on about that?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0400_10": "OK, already! If you’re that intent on working on it,\nI’ll think about it!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0500_10": "Really?!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0600_10": "Hahaha! Now that’s dedication!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0700_10": "Volkner! Sabrina! Is everything all right?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0800_10": "I heard you fought a massive bolt of lightning!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_0900_10": "Oh, that’s just an exaggeration. Who told you that?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1000_10": "No worries, everyone!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1100_10": "The cause of the commotion was just a Raichu\nand some Magnemite.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1200_10": "But these two sync pairs solved the problem,\nno sweat!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1300_10": "Awesome, you two!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1400_10": "Yes. You showed great skill.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1500_10": "I can’t say I’m proud that we caused problems for\neveryone, but...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1600_10": "We did make a pretty good team, didn’t we?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1700_10": "Yes, it wasn’t bad at all.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1800_10": "I’m actually not a huge fan of battling...but I had\na lot of fun today.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_1900_10": "I think you two might even be the winning team\nfor the New Year’s Battle Tournament!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2000_10": "Didn’t you have a pretty big winning streak?",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2200_10": "Uh... I stopped counting partway through.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2300_10": "And with all that commotion about the power\ngoing out, I completely forgot about it!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2400_10": "I don’t remember the details, but I think it’s fine as\nlong as we all had fun!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2500_10": "Hm...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2600_10": "Oh well. It’s still fantastic! Just fantastic!",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_2800_10": "Well... As long as everyone had fun, this\ntournament has been a huge success!",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_3000_10": "But somehow, all of this clamor is surprisingly\ncalming my spirit.",

    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_3400_10": "I’m sure we will!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_3500_10": "There are a lot of sync pairs here that remind me\nhow fun it is to battle!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2022/4008_1001_3600_10": "As long as we’re here on Pasio, it’s bound to be\nan exciting year!",
