    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_0401_0600_10": "Of course! I like Pokémon, obviously, but getting\nthe perfect shot of a Trainer’s smiling face is\nalways what makes me the most excited.",

    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_1000_10": "I’ve been taking photos all day today, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_1100_10": "I just want to get one more good one of you,\nand then I think I’ll take a break!",

    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_1400_10": "But a surprised face makes for quite a\nnice photo!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_1500_10": "So many Pokémon and Trainers have come to\nthis town, so everybody has a happy expression\non their face.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_1600_10": "I’ve been so busy, I’ve barely taken my eyes off\nmy camera’s viewfinder!",

    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_2100_10": "When you look at Pokémon through the\nviewfinder, you realize that each and every\none of them is totally unique.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_2200_10": "I mean, there are a lot of other Surskit out there\nbesides my Surskit.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_2300_10": "But not one of them is quite like mine.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_2400_10": "Some are cool, some are a little scary, some\nspace cadets, some mischievous...\nEach one is different, just like people.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_2500_10": "That’s why I never get tired of them at all.",

    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_0402_2900_10": "You get it, too. That shows me that you’re really\npaying attention to the Pokémon around you.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_3000_10": "This cutie has one expression that only I can\nbring out of her.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_3100_10": "I’m sure your Pokémon has a face that it only\never shows to you, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_3200_10": "For some Pokémon, it might only be a\nreally small difference.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_3300_10": "But those loving expressions are proof that your\nPokémon trusts you.",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2301_1201_3400_10": "Isn’t it just fantastic when you notice the small\nthings like that?",

    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_1201_0200_10": "Of course! Let’s give it all we’ve got in a\nshowdown between two lovers of\nBug-type Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_1201_0300_10": "OK! I’ll show you how all my research \nhere on Pasio has paid off!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0101_0100_10": "I’ll be carefully observing the power \nof your Bug-type Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0501_0100_10": "Whoa, your Surskit is amazing! And I thought \nmy Beedrill had been doing really well...",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0501_0200_10": "Yes, your Beedrill was really strong, too. \nI thought you had me there! Ooh, I know! \nLet’s take a photo to remember this by!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0501_0300_10": "Wait! Your Surskit looks like it’s about to evolve!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0501_0400_10": "Ooh, Surskit’s going to get even stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0039_00_viola/2311_0501_0500_10": "Fantastic! Just fantastic! I can’t let this photo op\nget away from me!"
