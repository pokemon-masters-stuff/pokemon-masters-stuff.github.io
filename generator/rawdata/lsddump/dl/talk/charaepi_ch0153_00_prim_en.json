    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_0300_10": "Well, hello there. You look like you’re positively\nitching for a Pokémon battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_0400_10": "While I admire your enthusiasm, you should know\nthat battling isn’t the only way to hone your skills.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0301_0500_10": "It isn’t?",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0401_0600_10": "Certainly not! Intensive training can be quite\neffective as well!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0302_0700_10": "What else is there?",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0402_0800_10": "Why, intensive training, of course! It can be\nquite effective!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_0900_10": "Since my dear Glalie is vulnerable to heat, I’ve\ndesigned a training regimen that focuses on that.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_1000_10": "I think your Pokémon could benefit as well.\nWould you care to join us?",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0301_1100_10": "Of course!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0401_1200_10": "Oh, I do love your enthusiasm.\nPlease, follow me right this way...",

    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_1800_10": "No... We choose to train in the climates we’re\nmost vulnerable to. That’s what makes it\nso effective.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_1900_10": "Well, shall we begin? We’ll start off gently...",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_2000_10": "After all, this training regimen isn’t just for our\nPokémon, it’s for us as well.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_2100_10": "First, let’s see how well you do in this sweltering\nheat when forced to act quickly on a decision.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_2200_10": "If the heat is feeling like it’s a bit too much for\nyou, you could always let Glalie cool you down...",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_2300_10": "but if you end up frozen stiff, he may just crunch\nyou right up in his jaws!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_2400_10": "Come on, Glalie! Give us your Ice Beam!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0301_2500_10": "Uhh, no thanks!\n*dodge*",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0401_2600_10": "My, what spectacular reflexes! You managed to\ndodge the Ice Beam perfectly.",

    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0302_2800_10": "I can handle it!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0402_2900_10": "My, my! You knew Glalie would miss right from\nthe beginning, didn’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_0402_3000_10": "Incredible! Ohohohoho!",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_3100_10": "Well done! I think I may have worked up a bit of\na sweat.",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_3200_10": "So many excellent sync pairs have made their\nway here to Pasio...",
    "charaepi_ch0153_00_prim/2301_1201_3300_10": "but there are a few among them who seem\nextra promising. I can’t help but want to butt in\nand give them advice.",
