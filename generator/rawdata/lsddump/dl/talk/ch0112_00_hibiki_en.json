    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0701_02_10": "Well, let’s see...\nBattles and tournaments are definitely a lot of fun.\nBut if I were to give a single reason...",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0701_03_10": "Because it’s fun to be with them!\nYou’re the same way, right?",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0702_01_10": "I thought it over, and I realized you don’t need\na reason to spend time with your friends or\nwith Pokémon!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2501_0702_02_10": "We need each other—that’s why we’re together.\nIt’s as simple as that!",
    "ch0112_00_hibiki/2511_0701_01_10": "Sometimes when I’m exploring the island...",
