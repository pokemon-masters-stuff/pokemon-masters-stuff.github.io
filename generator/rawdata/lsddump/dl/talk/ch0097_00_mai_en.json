    "ch0097_00_mai/0604_0701_03_10": "But I don’t mind talking to you like this.",
    "ch0097_00_mai/0604_0701_04_10": "I think it’s because you listen to me...",
    "ch0097_00_mai/0604_0702_01_10": "Perhaps you’re interested in me?",

    "ch0097_00_mai/0605_0701_04_10": "I might have said some embarrassing things.",

    "ch0097_00_mai/2511_0701_01_10": "I don’t like to talk, so I’ve always\nkept my distance from people.",
    "ch0097_00_mai/2511_0701_02_10": "But...you’ve always been there for me,\neven when I kept my distance...",
    "ch0097_00_mai/2511_0701_03_10": "And I started to enjoy talking...just a little...",
    "ch0097_00_mai/2511_0701_04_10": "I want to get better at talking because I want to\nknow more about you.",
