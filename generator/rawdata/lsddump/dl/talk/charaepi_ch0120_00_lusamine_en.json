    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_1201_1000_10": "But you may have overdone it a bit. Your clothes\nare filthy!",

    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_0302_4000_10": "I’ll go get cleaned up.",

    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_0401_5000_10": "Thank you. I’m glad we share the same opinion.",
    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_0302_5100_10": "Really?",
    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_0402_5200_10": "Well, who can say... But I do hope to understand\nPheromosa better by spending time with it.",
    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_1201_5300_10": "Why don’t you go and rest up for today?",
    "charaepi_ch0120_00_lusamine/2301_1201_5400_10": "We can have our battle some other time.\nPheromosa and I will be looking forward to it."
