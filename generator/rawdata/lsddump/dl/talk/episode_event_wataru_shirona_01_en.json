    "episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4008_1001_1400_10": "but that earnest, straightforward attitude of yours\nis one of your greatest strengths as well. If you\ncan learn to hone that, the sky is the limit!",

    "episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4008_1001_3000_10": "even if it means having others tease you or\naccuse you of running away from a challenge.",

    "episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4008_1001_4100_10": "All right, then. I can’t say I care much about the\ntitle of greatest dragon master, but if it means I\nget to battle against you, I’m definitely in!",
    "episode_event_wataru_shirona_01/4008_1001_4200_10": "I look forward to the day we can finally unleash\nour full power on the battlefield.",
