    "ch0046_00_datsura/0101_0701_02_10": "We can’t get this party started without you!\nI’m counting on you today, too!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0601_0701_01_10": "Pinsir is my bro. We’ve communicated—him with\nhis pincers and me with my fists—so many times\nwe understand each other perfectly!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0601_0701_02_10": "Clashing with body and spirit will allow anybody\nto understand each other.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0601_0701_03_10": "Even if we can’t talk to each other, Pokémon are\nhumanity’s best friend!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0601_0702_01_10": "If you want to be friends, you gotta butt heads\na few times!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0601_0702_02_10": "So if you got something on your mind, don’t hold\nnothin’ back. Come at me!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0701_01_10": "I’m the Frontier Brain that tests your knowledge.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0701_02_10": "I know it’s hard to imagine \nwith me lookin’ like this.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0701_03_10": "But knowledge ain’t just somethin’ you get\nby studyin’.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0701_04_10": "In order to experience everything, you need to\nhave a honed mind and body to handle it!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0702_01_10": "Everything is connected.\nNothing you do is ever a waste!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0602_0702_02_10": "You gotta know what you’re good at.\nThat is what’s gonna lead you to winning.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0603_0701_01_10": "Looks like there are a lot of areas that we still\ndon’t know about on Pasio.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0603_0701_02_10": "I gotta study up if I want to keep my title of\nFrontier Brain!",

    "ch0046_00_datsura/0603_0701_04_10": "I can’t stand not knowing something!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0603_0702_01_10": "And there are still plenty of things I don’t know\nout there.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0603_0702_02_10": "That’s just frustratin’, ain’t it?\nThat’s why I want to know more!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0701_01_10": "Back at the Battle Frontier where I’m from,\nyou fight each other with Pokémon that you rent.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0701_02_10": "So you and your opponent are on an even\nplaying field! If you can’t think outside the box,\nyour opponent will read you like a book!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0701_03_10": "No matter what hand you’re dealt, you gotta\nbring all your Pokémon knowledge to battle!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0701_04_10": "You’re tested on how well you can utilize\nrented Pokémon!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0702_01_10": "Even if you’re usin’ Pokémon that you’re not\naccustomed to, as long as you know about ’em,\nyou can be strong!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0604_0702_02_10": "If you can know your partner Pokémon’s moves,\ncharacteristics, and how it fights, that alone\ngives you a connection to it!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0701_01_10": "These guys on Pasio sure are fun!\nThey battle in ways I’ve never seen before!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0701_02_10": "There are so many things I would never have\nbeen able to experience had I stayed in Hoenn.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0701_03_10": "I gotta take this opportunity to study up!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0701_04_10": "You should do the same,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0701_05_10": "If you ever need help, you can count on me!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0702_01_10": "I’ll never be cheap with knowledge!\nWatch and learn as much as you can!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/0605_0702_02_10": "I promise you won’t regret it!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/1701_0701_01_10": "Here. This is for you!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/1701_0702_01_10": "You probably need this more than me.\nUse it well!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0701_01_10": "Whoa whoa, what’s wrong? You’re gonna go\nwin a Pokémon battle, ain’t ya?",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0701_02_10": "If you ever need my advice, you just gotta ask!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0701_03_10": "With our knowledge and experience combined,\nthere’s nothin’ we can’t handle!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0702_01_10": "If you ever get stuck, don’t just stop!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0702_02_10": "Try everything, and build up your experience!\nThen use that knowledge to get results!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2501_0702_03_10": "All I can do is help. You need to find your own\nresolve to get those results!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0701_01_10": "I see that all your efforts, big and small,\nare definitely making you stronger.",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0701_02_10": "Once we’re done with Pasio, come by the\nBattle Frontier!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0701_03_10": "With your skill, you’ll make it far. I know it!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0702_01_10": "Most don’t make it through the Battle Frontier\nwith force alone. ",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0702_02_10": "But you? You might even be able to win the\nentire thing!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/2511_0702_03_10": "If you’re gonna challenge us, though, you’d\nbetter be ready to go wild!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning!\nTime to start the day off with a spark!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3002_0701_01_10": "You’re looking a little sleepy there.\nC’mon! I’ll wake you up!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey hey! You look like you’re doing good.\nKeep it up, and keep it going!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3004_0701_01_10": "Hey! C’mon!\nLet’s get out there and do something!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3005_0701_01_10": "Just ’cause it’s late doesn’t mean I’m out\nof energy. C’mon! Try to keep up!",
    "ch0046_00_datsura/3006_0701_01_10": "You look like you’re still ready for more.\nC’mon! Let’s keep at it!"
