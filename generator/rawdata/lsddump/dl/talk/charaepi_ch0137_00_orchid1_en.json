    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_0400_10": "Yes. There’s no mistaking it. That is Mew!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_0500_10": "But why is it here on Pasio? Pasio shouldn’t have\nany wild Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_0600_10": "Which means it’s someone’s partner Pokémon?",

    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0401_0900_10": "Mew has been seen by only a very few people.\nIt’s referred to as a Mythical Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0302_1000_10": "What kind of Pokémon is Mew?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0402_1100_10": "Mew is called a Mythical Pokémon. Few have\never even caught a glimpse of it.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1200_10": "What’s the problem, you old geezer?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1300_10": "Seems the great Pokémon Professor is speechless\nand quaking in his shoes.",

    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1500_10": "What’s going on? I’ve never seen Gramps like\nthis before.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1600_10": "Really? I know that look quite well.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1700_10": "He gets overwhelmed with excitement and his\nheart is truly touched when he comes across a\nPokémon that hasn’t been seen on Pasio before.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1800_10": "Oh ho! That’s quite the expression! It reminds\nme of how you used to be back in the old days!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_1900_10": "So, what are you going to do? Don’t tell me\nyou’re satisfied just with seeing Mew?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0301_2000_10": "Mew looks ready for battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0401_2100_10": "Go for it, Gramps!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0302_2200_10": "Mew looks like it wants to play!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0402_2300_10": "Go for it, Gramps!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2400_10": "You’re right. I guess it’s time I go all out.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2500_10": "Not as a professor, but as a Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2600_10": "I’m going to challenge Mew to a battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2700_10": "Talk about bottomless energy! Mew seems like it\ncould take on a whole crowd of opponents and\nstill want more afterwards!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2800_10": "More than battling, it looks like it’s just playing\nand having fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_2900_10": "Yes. Mew’s nature, its habits, and just about\neverything about it are all shrouded in mystery.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3000_10": "However, having a battle with it has allowed me\nto unravel at least one of those mysteries today.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3100_10": "Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic code of\nevery Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3200_10": "It’s believed that that’s why it can use any move.",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3300_10": "That’s why Mew used so many different moves in\nour battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3400_10": "How was it? Did it fire up your passion as a\nTrainer again?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_3500_10": "Perhaps... Hm? What is it?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0301_3600_10": "Maybe Mew wants to battle again?",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0401_3700_10": "Hoho! Well, you certainly are a lively one, Mew!",
    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_0401_3800_10": "If you want to battle so much, why not come\nalong with me, Mew?",

    "charaepi_ch0137_00_orchid1/6204_1201_4600_10": "Seems I can’t afford to slack off now. I’ll need to\nprepare if I want to beat you, Oak.",
