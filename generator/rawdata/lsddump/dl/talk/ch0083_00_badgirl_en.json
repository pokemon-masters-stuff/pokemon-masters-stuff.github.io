    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2702_1031_02_10": "Who can guess what she’s\nthinking... It’s pointless.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2702_1031_03_10": "Does that, like, make me\na nihilist? Whatever.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2702_0701_01_10": "Dusclops doesn’t really make\nsense to me. Like, what’s going\non in that head of hers?",

    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_1031_02_10": "Facing Pokémon with low\nSpecial Defense is a total\nbreeze though.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_1031_03_10": "My Gengar and I have \nbeen hittin’ the books!",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_0701_01_10": "I, like, really want my Gengar to\nwin more battles.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_0701_02_10": "And, like, when I asked my teacher\nabout it, she told me Gengar’s got\nreally high Special Attack and stuff.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_0701_03_10": "So, like, against a Pokémon with\nlow Special Defense, Gengar’ll be\nsuper strong, I guess.",
    "ch0083_00_badgirl/2703_0701_04_10": "I mean, I wish she woulda told me\nthat sooner, though. Coulda saved\nGengar some trouble.",
