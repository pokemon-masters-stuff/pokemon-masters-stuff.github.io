    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_1031_03_10": "but there’s no one around\nto look me in the eye.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_0701_01_10": "If you’re eager to battle but you can’t\nseem to find an opponent...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_0701_02_10": "that’s when you should dash over to the\nPokémon Center and talk to Trista!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_0701_03_10": "She’ll help you reach out to your friends\nso you can go out exploring together!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_0702_01_10": "If you can’t seem to meet eyes with any\nother Trainers, you should go and talk to\nTrista at the reception desk!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2701_0702_02_10": "She’ll always be there to look you in the eye!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_1031_01_10": "Chopping wood is a cinch\nwith its two giant pincers.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_1031_02_10": "And impressively straight\nback, too.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_1031_03_10": "Perfectly straight posture!\nWhat I’d give for that...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_0701_01_10": "My partner here is the Stag Beetle\nPokémon, Pinsir!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_0701_02_10": "Pinsir’s the perfect Pokémon for a camper\nlike me! He can chop a piece of firewood\nin half lickety-split!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_0701_03_10": "His superflat back is the best part\nabout him, though! It sure makes riding\nPinsir easier than, say, Heracross!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2702_0702_01_10": "Then again, Heracross’s horn is a lot\neasier to grab on to.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_1031_01_10": "There are as many moves\nout there as there are\nPokémon types!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_1031_02_10": "There are ones that make\nyour Pokémon rock solid!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_1031_03_10": "And the more you use\nthem, the stronger your\nPokémon’s defenses get!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0701_01_10": "There are all kinds of different moves\nthat your Pokémon can use!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0701_02_10": "For example, there are moves \nthat can increase your Pokémon’s defenses \nor reduce your opponent’s! Isn’t that cool?!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0701_03_10": "If you use a move like that two or three times\nor more, it’ll be that much more effective!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0701_04_10": "Keep using it, and your Pokémon’ll be\nrock solid for sure!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0702_01_10": "Wait... What if my Pokémon could learn a move\nthat makes my opponent infatuated with me?!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2703_0702_02_10": "That...that would make me super popular!\nI wonder if moves can actually work\non people, not just Pokémon...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_1031_01_10": "Maybe I should listen to\nthe radio today, too...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_1031_02_10": "Gathering data is one of\nthe basics of being a\ngood Trainer, after all.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_1031_03_10": "I just learned that male\nand female Pokémon can\nlook really different.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0701_01_10": "Battling is a surefire way to make your\nPokémon stronger, but gathering data is\nreally important, too.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0701_02_10": "I’ve started listening to the radio to get my\ninformation. I bet I know way more about\nPokémon now!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0701_03_10": "Take Magikarp, for example! Did you know\nthat males have yellow whiskers and\nfemales have white?",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0701_04_10": "Whether or not that knowledge helps you\nmake your Pokémon stronger all depends\non you!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0702_01_10": "Knowledge is a greater weapon than\nraw strength.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2704_0702_02_10": "Knowing that Magikarp get super strong when\nthey evolve into Gyarados makes it easier\nto persevere through training one.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1031_01_10": "I only choose the most\nbeautiful Pokémon.\nThey suit me the best!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1031_02_10": "But what can I do to get\ncloser to my Pokémon?\nWhat’ll make him like me?",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1031_03_10": "Maybe I need to be more\nbeautiful! And confident!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1032_01_10": "You look pretty confident\nto me already, kid!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1032_02_10": "Shucks, I’m wonderin’ the\nsame thing! How do I get\nMY Pokémon to like me?",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_1032_03_10": "Shower him with\ncompliments, maybe?!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_01_10": "Aha! Maybe it’s all about showing affection!\nI should try petting and grooming my Weepinbell\nmore often. That oughta do the trick!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_02_10": "Ohoho! You may be right, m’boy!\nMy Onix is massive, though. Pettin’ and\ngroomin’ all that stone is no easy feat...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_03_10": "Hmm... Well then, how else are you gonna\nget your Pokémon to like you?",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_04_10": "Well, do you think just bein’ a swell person\nin general could be enough to get a Pokémon\nto warm up to you? Seems plausible.",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_05_10": "Yeah! I think you’re onto something!\nIf we want our Pokémon to like us more,\nwe’ve gotta work on ourselves first, huh!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_06_10": "Hmm... Think getting squeaky clean in the bath\nwill help? I should fix my hair, too... Maybe I\ncould get some fashion advice from a Sylveon!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_07_10": "Hey, you shouldn’t mention other Pokémon\naround your Weepinbell. He’ll get jealous,\nand that kinda defeats the purpose!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/2751_0701_08_10": "Really? Did I make you jealous, Weepinbell?\nI’m sorry, buddy. From now on, it’ll just be\nyou and me!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1901_0101_01_10": "I gotta look cool so I can show off\nto my girlfriend!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1901_0101_02_10": "Do me a favor and battle with me!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1901_0501_01_10": "*sigh*\nI’ll never be cool...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1901_0601_01_10": "I can be pretty stylish when I’m putting up\na tent, but that’s basically the only\ncool thing about me...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1901_0601_02_10": "I should just give up... Yep.\nI’m gonna spend the rest of my life boasting\nabout how well I can put up a tent...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1903_0101_01_10": "When it comes to camping, safety comes first!\nSame goes for Pokémon battling!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1903_0501_01_10": "I thought it was safe to say I’d beat you...",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1903_0601_01_10": "You know, you should always be prepared\nfor the unexpected!",
    "ch0086_00_campm/1903_0601_02_10": "Then again, if you’re always prepared for the\nunexpected, is it really unexpected anymore?"
