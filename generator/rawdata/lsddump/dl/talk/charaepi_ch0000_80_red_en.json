    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0301_0200_10": "Good luck, Red!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0401_0300_10": "... ... ...!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0302_0400_10": "Good luck, Leaf!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0402_0500_10": "Leave it to me! I have a few more tricks up\nmy sleeve!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_0600_10": "I thought I heard some loud noises around here.\nSo you all were battling, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_0700_10": "Aww! I lost!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_0800_10": "That was a great match. I can tell you’ve both\nbeen training your Pokémon quite a bit.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_0900_10": "Especially that Snorlax of yours, Red.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1000_10": "The way it was moving earlier shows you’ve been\nraising it well. It’s looking great!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1100_10": "Right? Red’s Snorlax is amazing!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1200_10": "Did you know that this Snorlax is the one Red\ncaught on our first adventure?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1300_10": "That’s why they’re so in sync, just like Red and\nCharizard! And it’s also why they’re able to pull\noff those perfect combinations!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1400_10": "I mean...my teamwork with Eevee and\nVenusaur is great, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1500_10": "One day, I know we’re gonna beat Red’s\nCharizard and Snorlax!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1600_10": "Until then, I’m not gonna stop challenging them!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1700_10": "I see. When you say your first adventure...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1800_10": "Do you mean your travels through the\nKanto region?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_1900_10": "Yup! That’s the region Blue, Red, and I\nexplored first!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2000_10": "That’s also where Red met Snorlax!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0301_2100_10": "So he caught Snorlax there?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0401_2200_10": "Well...actually, he had to wake him up first!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0302_2300_10": "Did he trade someone for Snorlax?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_0402_2400_10": "Actually, it all started when Red woke him up!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2500_10": "Red had to wake him up?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2600_10": "Yup! Snorlax was blocking a road while taking a\nnap, so Red played a flute to wake him up!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2700_10": "Then they battled, and that’s how Red caught him!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2800_10": "That happened not too long after Red first became\na Trainer, so it was a tough battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_2900_10": "It was so close, he only barely caught him!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3000_10": "What a fascinating story. I wish I’d been there to\nsee it.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3100_10": "I imagine it was a great battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3200_10": "Yeah! It must’ve been fierce, because Snorlax was\nso strong to begin with!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3300_10": "I was so jealous when I heard Red\ncaught Snorlax...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3400_10": "Oh? Did you also give it a try?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3500_10": "*chuckle* Actually, I did!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3600_10": "... ... ...!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3700_10": "I wasn’t strong enough to catch him at\nthe time.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3800_10": "But that’s why I think Red’s Snorlax is so cool!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_3900_10": "I see. So that loss just made you fonder of\nthat Snorlax, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_4000_10": "Exactly! And that’s why I wanna battle you\nagain, Red!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_4100_10": "I’m sure you’re ready to go another round,\naren’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_80_red/2301_1201_4200_10": "... ... ...!"
