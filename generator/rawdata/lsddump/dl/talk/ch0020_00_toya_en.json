    "ch0020_00_toya/0101_0701_02_10": "Battles seem more fun when you’re around.\nLet’s do our best today, too!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0701_01_10": "I’ve been traveling all over the place, \nand then I was called here to Pasio.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0701_02_10": "Traveling is good for you. You get to see new\nsights and meet new people and Pokémon.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0701_03_10": "You’re one of the new people I’ve met \nduring my travels, you know? \nAnd I’m very happy for that!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0702_01_10": "Don’t you think it’s kind of miraculous when\nwe meet new people or Pokémon?",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0702_02_10": "The world is so big, there are so many people\nand Pokémon that’ll never meet each other...",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0702_03_10": "And yet we’ve met here, and now we’re\ntalking and becoming friends!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0601_0702_04_10": "I hope we can make this meeting something\nreally special.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0701_01_10": "I like Pokémon battles because I really want to\nexperience the joy of victory, I guess.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0701_02_10": "So much goes into winning a battle.\nYou have to plan your strategy, raise your\nPokémon, read your opponent’s moves...",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0701_03_10": "It just feels wonderful when you can bring\nall those factors together and seize victory!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0702_01_10": "When we win, my Pokémon get really\nhappy, too!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0702_02_10": "That goes for that frustrating feeling when we\nlose, too, of course.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0602_0702_03_10": "I think Pokémon battles are a form\nof communication.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0701_01_10": "I know my Oshawott is pretty tiny,\nbut he’s really good at Pokémon battles.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0701_02_10": "He’s defeated much larger Pokémon by using his\nsmaller size as an advantage.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0701_03_10": "He’s the best partner I could have for my travels!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0702_01_10": "My Oshawott is, what do you call it...\nStoic, I guess.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0702_02_10": "He wakes up earlier than even I do and\ngoes out on his own to train.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0603_0702_03_10": "I guess he’s strong because he takes battles\nso seriously...?",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0701_01_10": "Even if it’s a place you’ve been to many times\nbefore, you can discover new things if you just\npay a little closer attention.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0701_02_10": "I really enjoy looking for little secrets\nlike that, you know?",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0701_03_10": "You might discover a path you never saw before\nor meet new Pokémon. It’s hard to quit exploring\nonce you get into it!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0701_04_10": "I’d love it if we could go exploring together, too!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0702_01_10": "Forests and mountains are fun to explore, sure,\nbut cities can also be really exciting.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0702_02_10": "My favorite thing to do is look for great\nrestaurants that are off the beaten path!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0604_0702_03_10": "Besides, if the Pokémon I meet seem like they’re\nhaving fun, it makes me smile, too!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0701_01_10": "I feel comfortable when I’m with you.\nYou’re reassuring, somehow.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0701_02_10": "So, y’know, even if you become an\namazing Trainer...",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0701_03_10": "I hope our relationship won’t change.\nI hope we’ll stay friends.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0701_04_10": "So, uh, this is a little embarrassing, but...\nLet’s stick together, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0702_01_10": "When I watch your Pokémon battles,\nit makes me feel...",
    "ch0020_00_toya/0605_0702_02_10": "It’s hard to explain. Like my heart’s on fire?\nIt makes me want to battle, too.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/1701_0701_01_10": "Hey, I found something good, so I figured\nI’d share it with you!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/1701_0701_02_10": "It’s best to share happiness with another\nperson, after all!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/1701_0702_01_10": "I’m pretty good at finding items, since\nI’ve traveled so much.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/1701_0702_02_10": "I’ll let you know if I find anything else good!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2501_0701_01_10": "I’m really looking forward to \nthe Pokémon battles on Pasio.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2501_0701_02_10": "Each place has its own powerful Trainers.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2501_0701_03_10": "So whenever I’m going to face strong Trainers, I\nalways wonder how far I’ll be able to go.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2501_0702_01_10": "Seeing you get stronger and stronger... It really\nmakes me feel like I can’t lag behind, either!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2501_0702_02_10": "In other words, you are a great inspiration\nfor me!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0701_01_10": "I’m a bit of a sore loser.\nI try not to let it show, since I don’t want\npeople thinking I’m childish.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0701_02_10": "But that does mean I battle to win, even if\nit’s against you!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0701_03_10": "You’re my friend, and that’s why I want to go\nall out in our battles!\nNo holding grudges, even if you lose!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0702_01_10": "It’s like, we’re together a lot...but that’s\nexactly why I don’t want to lose.\nDo you have that kind of competitiveness, too?",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0702_02_10": "I guess having this kind of feeling about\neach other is what you’d call a rivalry.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/2511_0702_03_10": "Well, I hope we can stay good friends—and\ngood rivals!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Did ya eat a good breakfast?\nYou’ll feel better if you eat.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning! Sleep well? I can’t wait to have\na ton of Pokémon battles today!",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3003_0701_01_10": "Good afternoon! Eating lunch made me sleepy...",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3004_0701_01_10": "Afternoon! Wanna go for a walk or something?\nOh, and while we’re at it,\nI also want to do some Pokémon battles.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening! It’s a nice night, right?\nQuiet, calm, and pleasant.",
    "ch0020_00_toya/3006_0701_01_10": "Evening. A day goes by fast, huh.\nI’m not done having fun yet!"
