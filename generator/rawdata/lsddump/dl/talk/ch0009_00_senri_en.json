    "ch0009_00_senri/0101_0701_02_10": "When I see how much you or my son has grown\nand accomplished, I can’t help but think I need\nto train more, too.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0601_0701_01_10": "The Trainers of my Gym are all very powerful.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0601_0701_02_10": "True strength acquired from proper practice\nmeans not running from even the most difficult\nof battles.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0601_0701_03_10": "When you face a challenge, I want you to\nanswer it with all you’ve got!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0601_0702_01_10": "At my Gym, everyone battles each other\nwithout ever holding back, all in the name\nof growing stronger.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0601_0702_02_10": "I am no different. I am always thinking of new\nways to win in battle.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0701_01_10": "Sometimes I run into my kid at the\nPokémon Center.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0701_02_10": "The other day I saw him wearing his clothes\ninside out. Honestly, he can be so careless\nsometimes. It reminds me of someone...",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0701_03_10": "What? No, not me!\nI’d never do something like wear my\nclothes incorrectly!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0702_01_10": "Torn, tattered, or dirtied clothes...",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0702_02_10": "Whenever we see each other, we both look that\nway, I suppose.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0602_0702_03_10": "Looking like that...\nI feel like I should say something, but I just\nend up laughing.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0701_01_10": "Slaking is very powerful, but he will start\nloafing around right away. That’s his weakness.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0701_02_10": "I understand Slaking’s strong and weak points,\nso I want to make the most of everything\nhe is able to do!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0701_03_10": "If you understand the strengths and\nweaknesses of Pokémon, too,\nbattles will become much easier for you.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0702_01_10": "I don’t just mean your own Pokémon, either.\nKnowing about all kinds of Pokémon is important.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0702_02_10": "If you do, you’ll be ready to counter against\nany Pokémon’s strengths.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0603_0702_03_10": "If you want to learn about Slaking’s power,\nI’m ready to battle anytime!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0604_0701_01_10": "I’ve got a few other Pokémon besides\nSlaking here, but they’re all back at home\nlooking after my Gym.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0604_0701_02_10": "I wonder how they’re doing with the Trainers...\nNot slacking off, I hope!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0604_0701_03_10": "Blissey and Linoone are probably all right, but\nSpinda’s eyes are always spinning around and it\nhas a tendency to wander off.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0604_0702_01_10": "They’re all definitely training hard every day.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0604_0702_02_10": "That goes for people, too! It’s no different for\npeople or Pokémon! If you want to get stronger,\nyou can’t hold anything back!",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0605_0701_01_10": "Have you ever considered the emotions that come\nwith a battle’s end, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0605_0701_02_10": "Happiness, sadness...\nThere are many different things you can feel.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0605_0701_03_10": "All of those feelings become the foundation of\nyour strength, so remember them well.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0605_0702_01_10": "Losing, even when you battle with all\nyour might, is painful—even for adults.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/0605_0702_02_10": "What I mean is that hating to lose is a\nchildish thing to do.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/1701_0701_01_10": "I’ve been looking for you!\nI was thinking I wanted to give this to you.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/1701_0701_02_10": "I think you’ll be able to put that to good use.\nI’ll continue to keep supporting you.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/1701_0702_01_10": "That gift I gave you a while ago?\nYou don’t have to worry about giving me\nanything in return.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/1701_0702_02_10": "I thought you could use it, so I gave it to you.\nThat’s all there is.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0701_01_10": "It may be surprising, but even I get worried\nabout things sometimes.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0701_02_10": "For example, when I go on a trip, I always\nworry about what kind of souvenirs I should\nbring back as gifts.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0701_03_10": "What, you thought it was a more serious\nkind of worry? Well to me, that is serious.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0701_04_10": "It’s something that will travel far and be given\nto someone. So I have to choose carefully.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0702_01_10": "To find a great gift, I actually did \na bunch of research about Pasio.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0702_02_10": "There are just so many different things I’m sure\nmy family would like.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2501_0702_03_10": "Hmm. I can’t decide. If you see something good,\nlet me know.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0701_01_10": "As a Trainer and as a Gym Leader, I’ve learned\nmany things.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0701_02_10": "But even so, I still feel like I’m not giving it \nmy all. That’s why I’m participating in the PML.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0701_03_10": "Winning a battle isn’t easy. Especially since there\nare so many strong Trainers like you around.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0701_04_10": "There’s a lot to learn! My hope right now is to\nlearn as much as I can from everyone.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0702_01_10": "Tactics and counter tactics are different between\nregions and generations.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0702_02_10": "However, changing to whatever others do isn’t\nactual strength.\nA strong Trainer has unshakable conviction.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/2511_0702_03_10": "When I see you battle, I’m reminded of my son.\nI think you two are similarly determined.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning.\nLet’s give it our best effort today.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3002_0701_01_10": "Morning. Did you sleep well?\nI’ll be counting on you today.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3003_0701_01_10": "Have you eaten?\nYou must take care of your body.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3004_0701_01_10": "Time sure can fly in the afternoon.\nBe careful not to waste too much of it.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3005_0701_01_10": "Days with you sure go by fast.\nMake sure to rest up for tomorrow.",
    "ch0009_00_senri/3006_0701_01_10": "It’s already getting dark. Watch your step,\nand keep an eye out for nocturnal Pokémon."
