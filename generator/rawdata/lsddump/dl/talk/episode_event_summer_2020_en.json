    "episode_event_summer_2020/4005_1001_3800_10": "If it’s all right with you two, I think it might be a\ngood idea to give this statue to Steven. What do\nyou think?",
    "episode_event_summer_2020/4005_1001_3900_10": "Fine by me! It’s too heavy to fit in my\nluggage anyway.",
    "episode_event_summer_2020/4005_1001_4000_10": "Yeah, I don’t mind. He’d be taking a load off our\nhands. Literally...",
    "episode_event_summer_2020/4005_1001_4100_10": "Hehe. Great! Thanks, you two!",
    "episode_event_summer_2020/4005_1001_4200_10": "Well, you heard them. This statue is our gift to\nyou, Steven!",
