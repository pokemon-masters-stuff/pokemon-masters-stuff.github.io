    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_0200_10": "What’s up?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_0300_10": "Well, there’s something that’s bothering me.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_0400_10": "A favor?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_0500_10": "Yeah, there’s something that’s bothering me.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_0600_10": "Apparently, my face gets really angry\nwhenever I battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_0700_10": "And sometimes—just sometimes!—the\nother Trainer and their Pokémon get\na little scared of me.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_0800_10": "Oh, I see.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_0900_10": "So, let’s try this out. Look close!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_1000_10": "I gotta see this!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_1100_10": "OK, let’s try this out. Look close!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_1200_10": "... ... ...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_1300_10": "What do you think, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nWas my face a little off-putting?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_1400_10": "Uh, well...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_1500_10": "You don’t have to say it... I get it.\nBut it’s a habit, you know?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_1600_10": "It’s not something I can just stop doing\nthat easily!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_1700_10": "No, of course not...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_1800_10": "Really? Oh, thank goodness!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_1900_10": "But if that’s the case, I wonder what those\nTrainers and Pokémon were so scared of...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2000_10": "Then again, I don’t think putting on your game\nface during a battle is necessarily a bad thing.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2100_10": "You have to get serious during battles,\nor you’ll lose.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2200_10": "Besides...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2300_10": "I have a lot riding on my battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2400_10": "I know Tepig understands that as we’re\nbattling together.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2500_10": "The relationship between Trainers and their\nPokémon is hard to define.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2600_10": "Arguably, the one and only thing that defines our\nrelationship with our Pokémon is their Poké Ball.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_2700_10": "It can seem one-sided and fickle.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_2800_10": "Yeah, but...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_2900_10": "I know. I don’t think our relationship with our\nPokémon is as cold as that, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_3000_10": "That’s wrong, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_3100_10": "I know. I don’t think our relationship with our\nPokémon is as cold as that, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_3200_10": "But I remembered these guys\nwho called themselves Team Plasma\nback in the Unova region.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_3300_10": "They would make a fuss about how we should\nliberate the Pokémon from their Poké Balls.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_3400_10": "I guess they saw it as us enslaving the Pokémon\nusing Poké Balls.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_3500_10": "So if we were able to form a bond so strong\nthat neither Trainers nor Pokémon would be\nbothered by the Poké Balls...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_3600_10": "Maybe if we could do that, we wouldn’t \nhave blockheads like them jumping to \nthe wrong conclusion.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_3700_10": "You have a point there!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_3800_10": "All in all, Trainers and Pokémon have their own\nwants, desires, and goals.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_3900_10": "That’d be a big undertaking...\nwouldn’t it?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_4000_10": "All in all, Trainers and Pokémon have their own\nwants, desires, and goals.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4100_10": "As long as they overlap and coincide, that means\nthe two of you are strongly connected.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4200_10": "And if that’s the case, you can work together\nwhether or not there’s a Poké Ball, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4300_10": "So I sat down and got to thinking about \nwhat makes a really strong bond.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4400_10": "I like Pokémon battles, and \nTepig likes Pokémon battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4500_10": "That’s why we don’t want to lose—and why we\ntry our darndest to make sure we win.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4600_10": "Wouldn’t you say that’s a strong connection?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4700_10": "If we’re that in sync, that should mean that we\nboth want to win the PML the same way, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4800_10": "I’m sure that Tepig would choose the right move\neven if I didn’t give the instruction!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_4900_10": "Right, Tepig? If you were to use a move right\nthis moment, you’d choose Flame Charge, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0301_5000_10": "Totally in sync!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0401_5100_10": "I know, right?! I’m so glad we’re partners.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0302_5200_10": "Tepig looks really happy!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_0402_5300_10": "I know, right?! I’m so glad we’re partners.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_5400_10": "I bet seeing how in sync we are makes you\neven more excited to battle with us, huh!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_5500_10": "I would know—because I’m really excited to\nbattle you, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_5600_10": "You and your Pokémon are of the same mind,\njust like Tepig and me.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_5700_10": "I couldn’t ask for a better opponent!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2301_1201_5800_10": "So when we do battle, show me just how\nsynchronized you and your Pokémon are!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_1201_0100_10": "People always tell me they know what I’m\nthinking just by looking at my face.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_1201_0200_10": "That’s true. I bet I can totally guess what you’re \nthinking right now.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_1201_0300_10": "I’m not really one to talk, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_1201_0400_10": "I’m not very good at like, trying to outwit\nsomebody with tricky moves in battle, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_1201_0500_10": "I just go straight at my opponent when it comes\ntime for a Pokémon battle! Everything works out if\nyou just push through as hard as you can!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0101_0100_10": "Let’s see how hot the two of us can make\na Pokémon battle get!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0101_0200_10": "OK! But do you really think you can stop us?\nI’m really driven to win!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0100_10": "Oof, you and Tepig ran right over us. That was\nabout as hot as a battle can get! ",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0200_10": "You and Torkoal were pretty awesome, too!\nI thought you had us there.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0300_10": "I think both of us being easy to read is just proof\nof how passionate we are about Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0400_10": "You know, maybe you’re right! We shouldn’t be\nembarrassed—we should be proud!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0500_10": "Tepig?! What’s happening?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2311_0501_0600_10": "Oh, you’re evolving! All right! Now you can\ngrow even more!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_1201_0100_10": "Hello there, Hilda! Looks like you’ve been working\nhard, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_1201_0200_10": "Yup! We met all kinds of Trainers and battled\nthem all. Now Pignite and I are so much stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_1201_0300_10": "Oh, well, if that’s the case, then perhaps we\nshould see who’s the strongest between us.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_1201_0400_10": "You got it! I’m giving this one everything I’ve got!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0101_0100_10": "Everything I’ve seen on my adventures, everything\nI’ve felt—I’m putting it all into winning this battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0101_0200_10": "That’s what I like to hear! I want to see you really\nbreak out of your shell and go for it!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0100_10": "Now I see... You’re as strong as—no, even\nstronger than I’d heard.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0200_10": "And it’s not just about raw power. The trust you\nand Pignite have in each other is precisely why\nyou’re able to perform so well.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0300_10": "Yeah! We’ve been through so much together,\nafter all.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0400_10": "Well, you got me. I’m looking forward to seeing\njust how strong you two can get.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0500_10": "Whoa! Pignite, are you evolving?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_00_toko/2312_0501_0600_10": "Cheren did say we should break out of our shell.\nI guess this is one way to do it!"
