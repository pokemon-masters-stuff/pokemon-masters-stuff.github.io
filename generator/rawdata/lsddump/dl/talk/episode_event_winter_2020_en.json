    "episode_event_winter_2020/4003_0402_1600_10": "Yes, that’s a good idea. I think it must have\nblown downwind.",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4003_1001_1700_10": "OK! Togekiss, could you lead the way?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_0100_10": "Hmm. I don’t see it, but I’m pretty sure it should\nbe somewhere close by...",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0301_0200_10": "We’ll do our best to find it, Comfey!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0401_0300_10": "It was a pretty wreath, after all! Let’s find it quick!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0302_0400_10": "Don’t worry—I’ll find it for you!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0402_0500_10": "Looks like that made Comfey feel a little better! \nLet’s hurry and find it!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_0600_10": "That decoration was based off the wreath that\nComfey makes by picking out flowers and tying\nthem together.",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_0700_10": "That must be why Comfey is so anxious to find it.",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_0800_10": "Don’t worry—I’m sure we’ll find it soon!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_0900_10": "Now where’d you get a pretty wreath like that?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1000_10": "Hey, that person over there is holding a wreath!\nCould that be the decoration that Erika and\nComfey made?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0301_1100_10": "Let’s go ask them!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0401_1200_10": "Good idea! We should thank them for finding it,\nbut we have to ask them about it first!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0302_1300_10": "That Trainer also has a Comfey!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0402_1400_10": "Yes, I’d like to thank them personally for finding it.\nLet’s go over and talk to them!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1500_10": "Um, excuse me! Could I take a look at that wreath\nyou’re holding?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1600_10": "Hm? This wreath, you mean? So it’s yours?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1700_10": "Yes, that’s the one my Comfey and I made!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1800_10": "Well then, glad we found its rightful owner! Here\nyou— Huh?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_1900_10": "What are you getting all upset about? This wreath\nbelongs to these people!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2000_10": "Could it be it doesn’t want to let go because it\nthinks the wreath is another Comfey?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2100_10": "Maybe, but still...come on. That’s not ours. \nWe have to give it back!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2200_10": "Wait, I’ve come up with an idea!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2300_10": "Perhaps if we did something fun together, we\ncould get your Comfey to be more comfortable \nwith letting it go! What do you think of that?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2400_10": "That might be the way to do it!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_1001_2500_10": "What do you think, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0301_2600_10": "Let’s do something fun, Comfey!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0401_2700_10": "Yeah! Let’s have a fun Pokémon battle to make it\nfeel more comfortable giving the wreath back!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0302_2800_10": "Let’s have a fun Pokémon battle!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4004_0402_2900_10": "To make it as fun as possible, I won’t hold back!\nI shall not lose!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4005_1001_0100_10": "Did ya have fun? Then let’s go ahead and give\nthat wreath back to them, OK?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4005_1001_0200_10": "Thanks a bunch! With this, we can complete\nour tree!",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4005_1001_0300_10": "Hm? You’re doin’ something with this decoration\nand a tree?",
    "episode_event_winter_2020/4005_1001_0400_10": "Yup! Actually...",

    "episode_event_winter_2020/4006_1001_0600_10": "We could make it stand out a little bit more,\nI think. Oh, thank you for passing me this flower,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
