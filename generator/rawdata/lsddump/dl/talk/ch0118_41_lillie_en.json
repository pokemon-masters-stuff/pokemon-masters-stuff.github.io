    "ch0118_41_lillie/0101_0701_02_10": "Would you like to join me?",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7101_0701_01_10": "Apparently, this dress I’m wearing was inspired\nby Polteageist!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7101_0701_02_10": "When I’m wearing this outfit, Polteageist seems\nhappier than usual when it makes tea.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7101_0701_03_10": "It’s fun to get dressed up for tea parties, don’t\nyou think?",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7102_0701_01_10": "Did you know Polteageist has two forms?\nApparently, it can be either Antique Form\nor Phony Form.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7102_0701_02_10": "People say my Polteageist is rare because it’s an\nAntique Form Polteageist, but I’ve never really\nthought much about it.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7102_0701_03_10": "It makes no difference to me which form it\nis—I just love my Polteageist for what it is!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7103_0701_01_10": "Polteageist’s tea has a really distinctive flavor!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7103_0701_02_10": "It let me drink a little once.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7103_0701_03_10": "Hmm, I can’t think of a way to describe it well...",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7103_0701_04_10": "If you ever become friends with Polteageist,\nit might let you drink some, too!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7104_0701_01_10": "The pot my Polteageist is living in...",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7104_0701_02_10": "Apparently, it’s an antique—but when exactly do\nyou suppose it was made?",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7104_0701_03_10": "I’m really curious!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7105_0701_01_10": "I’d like to get better at making sweets as\nwell as tea.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/7105_0701_02_10": "If I could do that, I’m sure I could have even more\nfun with my partner Pokémon—and with you,\ntoo, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/1701_0701_01_10": "Here, you can have this!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/1701_0702_01_10": "I hope it helps on your adventure!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2501_0701_01_10": "I’ve heard that whenever Polteageist finds some\nleftover black tea, it pours itself into it.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2501_0701_02_10": "Honestly, if it allows me to meet such a wonderful\nPokémon, I wouldn’t mind leaving a little tea in\nmy cup...",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2501_0701_03_10": "Wait, no! What am I talking about? Those are two\ntotally separate things!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2501_0702_01_10": "Ever since coming to Pasio, I’ve been studying tea.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2501_0702_02_10": "I’ll do my best to learn more so I can make really\ndelicious tea for everyone!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2511_0701_01_10": "Would you mind telling me your opinion of some\nnew tea I have?",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2511_0701_02_10": "I tried blending some different tea leaves together\ninto a flavor I thought you might like!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2511_0701_03_10": "Let’s have some right now with some malasadas!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2511_0702_01_10": "I want to learn the proper etiquette to make and\nserve tea...",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/2511_0702_02_10": "But honestly, the most important thing to remember\nis just to have fun with your friends!",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/3001_0701_01_10": "When I wake up in the morning and feel the\nsunshine hit my face, all of my sleepiness\njust floats away.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/3003_0701_01_10": "Pasio is a lovely place, isn’t it? Everyone is so\nvery kind here.",
    "ch0118_41_lillie/3005_0701_01_10": "Did you have a good day today? Fingers crossed\nthat tomorrow will be a good day, too!"
