    "ch0259_00_sania/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m getting excited thinking about how many sync\npairs we’ll meet up with today!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7101_0701_01_10": "Partner Pokémon always come ’round looking for\nattention when you’re trying to read a book, don’t\nthey. You know what I mean...right?",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7101_0701_02_10": "Now that I think about it, I guess it only happens\nwhen I’ve had my head in a book for so long that\nI’ve forgotten to eat...",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7102_0701_01_10": "Are you a “thinking Trainer” or a “feeling\nTrainer?”",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7102_0701_02_10": "A thinking Trainer does careful research, while a\nfeeling Trainer trusts their instincts.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7102_0701_03_10": "I’m the type to rely on my knowledge in a\nPokémon battle, but y’know, in the end, I think the\nTrainer that’s having the most fun wins.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7102_0701_04_10": "So I guess at the end of the day, we’re all just\n“fun-loving Trainers!”",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7103_0701_01_10": "When I get really into my research, I don’t have a\nsingle moment to spare on fashion or makeup.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7103_0701_02_10": "My friend Nessa is a Gym Leader AND a model.\nHonestly, I don’t know how she does it.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7104_0701_01_10": "Is there anyone that you look up to? Personally,\nI really look up to my gran.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7104_0701_02_10": "Her name’s Professor Magnolia, and she was the\nfirst one to research the Dynamax phenomenon.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7104_0701_03_10": "The best way I can repay my gran for all she’s\ndone is by becoming an amazing professor myself!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. What do you\nthink about people whose rooms are a mess?",
    "ch0259_00_sania/7105_0701_02_10": "I’ve been so into reading lately, and before I\nrealized it... Ugh, I’ve really got to tidy up!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/1701_0701_01_10": "Since you’ve been working so hard, here’s a\npresent!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/1701_0702_01_10": "I thought you might like it. Use it carefully!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0701_01_10": "In the Galar region, we have something called the\nGym Challenge. Trainers go around and try to\ncollect badges from eight Gyms.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0701_02_10": "I did the challenge, too, and I did well at first, but\nI just couldn’t beat the young man I was traveling\naround with. Then I gave up on being a Trainer.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0701_03_10": "I’ve got no regrets. That’s the whole reason I\ndecided to become a researcher.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0701_04_10": "But I often wonder what would’ve happened if I’d\njust stuck with it a bit longer.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0702_01_10": "Now I feel like I want to get back into doing\nPokémon battles again.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2501_0702_02_10": "I was really inspired after seeing how much fun\nyou have when you battle!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0701_01_10": "In Galar and in other regions, there are Legendary\nPokémon. Tales about them have been passed\ndown from ancient times.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0701_02_10": "So far, no Legendary Pokémon have originated\nfrom Pasio.",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0701_03_10": "But it’s an island that will build up a rich history\nand be loved by many people, so it’s only a\nmatter of time!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0701_04_10": "I hope that the moment a new Legendary\nPokémon appears on Pasio, I’ll be here to\nwitness it firsthand!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0702_01_10": "For now, I can spend my time doing extensive\nresearch on you!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/2511_0702_02_10": "Oh, calm down! I just mean that I’ll go along and\nbattle together with you until I’ve figured out\nyour secrets!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Let’s give it our all out there today!\nAnd no matter what, stay positive!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey! Don’t think I didn’t see you dozing off\nearlier, sleepyhead. Come on, the day’s just\ngetting started!",
    "ch0259_00_sania/3005_0701_01_10": "Are you still planning on running around even\nafter dark? Well, just watch your step, all right?\nStay sharp!"
