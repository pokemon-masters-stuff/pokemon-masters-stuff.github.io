    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_0200_10": "Thanks for joining me today! I hope it’s not too\nmuch of a bother.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_0300_10": "I tend to notice things when you’re around, so I\nfigured I’d invite you.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_0400_10": "Now...I wonder what region and era these ruins\nare based on.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0301_0500_10": "Aaaah!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0401_0600_10": "Oh! Sorry for surprising you like that.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0302_0700_10": "What’s that?!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0402_0800_10": "Sorry if that surprised you. That was quite sudden,\nwasn’t it.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_0900_10": "This is my partner, Giratina.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1000_10": "Giratina’s actually from a different world, one on\nthe reverse side of ours.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1100_10": "It’s able to move freely between our world and\nthat other world...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1200_10": "But sometimes it even surprises me because it\npops up out of nowhere!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1300_10": "I’m sure it means no harm, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1400_10": "You know, I’ve actually been to the world\nGiratina is from.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1500_10": "Time didn’t flow, and space wasn’t stable... It was\na world where the rules are broken.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1600_10": "It was a space one might call the Distortion World.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1700_10": "There are a few existing theories as to why\nGiratina was in a world like that.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1800_10": "According to one, Giratina was banished to\nanother world for its violence.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_1900_10": "However, as I kept examining myths and\nreference materials from different angles, I started\nto uncover the truth.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_2000_10": "I think Giratina is actually a kind soul,\nwatching over our world from the shadows to\nprotect us.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_2100_10": "Oh! I guess Giratina went back to its world.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_2200_10": "Maybe it just dropped in to say hello to\nyou, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0301_2300_10": "So you’re not always together?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0401_2400_10": "That’s right. We spend a lot of time apart from\neach other.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0401_2500_10": "But...that doesn’t mean I’m lonely.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0302_2600_10": "Isn’t it lonely when Giratina’s gone?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_0402_2700_10": "Oh, I’m actually OK with it.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_2800_10": "Even when we’re worlds apart, we’re always\ntogether in spirit.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_2900_10": "I know that Giratina will always be there for me.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_3000_10": "I’m sure it’s even watching over us now, as\nwe speak!",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_3100_10": "OK! That’s enough of a break. Shall we get back\nto work?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_20_shirona/2301_1201_3200_10": "I certainly can’t leave here empty-handed.\nGiratina would have a good laugh at me."
