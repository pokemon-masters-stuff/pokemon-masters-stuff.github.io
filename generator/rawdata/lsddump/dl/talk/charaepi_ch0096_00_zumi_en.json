    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0300_10": "Thanks to you, I was able to gather\nall of the ingredients I need in record time.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0400_10": "Soon, with the expert touch of my chef’s knife,\nthese fresh, crisp vegetables will be reborn!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0500_10": "Whether the ingredients shine beautifully\nin the dish or end up ruining it\ndepends on the skill of the chef.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0600_10": "We chefs must carefully consider our\ningredients and take full responsibility \nfor the outcome of each dish we create.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0700_10": "Ingredients and chefs,\nPokémon and Trainers...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0800_10": "The relationships between them are\nquite similar in a lot of ways.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_0900_10": "I think that’s why both of them \nappeal to me so much.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_1000_10": "I hate to change the subject so abruptly,\nbut I have a question I’d like to ask you.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_1100_10": "Do you believe that Pokémon have\nlimitless potential?",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0301_1200_10": "I do.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_1300_10": "Interesting...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_1400_10": "Many Pokémon live their lives very close\nto our own, while others do not show\nthemselves in front of people at all.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_1500_10": "Most of them are shrouded in mystery.\nTherefore, we can’t possibly know how\nlimitless their potential truly is.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_1600_10": "To draw out the hidden potential in our\nPokémon—to create a future full of possibility—\nis the greatest mission of all for us Trainers.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0302_1700_10": "I don’t think so.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_1800_10": "What foolishness!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_1900_10": "How can you place a limit on your\nPokémon’s potential and still call\nyourself a Pokémon Trainer?!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_2000_10": "A Trainer and their Pokémon play \nvital roles in each other’s future.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_2100_10": "They go through their lives together.\nThey hurt together and they help together.\nThey must continue to survive together.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_2200_10": "If Trainers can’t believe in their Pokémon or\nwould try to limit their Pokémon’s potential,\nmaybe the world is better off without them!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_2300_10": "Oh dear, I must apologize...\nI got a bit too carried away.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_2400_10": "Personally, I do believe that Pokémon have\nlimitless potential hidden deep within them.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_2500_10": "The PML is like a great, brilliant stage\nwhere we can witness that potential\nwith our own two eyes.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_2600_10": "Nothing makes me happier than\nwatching a Pokémon battle...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_2700_10": "and witnessing firsthand the incredible\npotential that Trainers are able to\ndraw out of their Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0301_2800_10": "Then let’s do our absolute best!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_2900_10": "Always! Of course!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_3000_10": "Trainers can help draw out the potential\nin their fellow Trainers as well, you know!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0302_3100_10": "I’m a little lost...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_3200_10": "Pardon me?\nHave you been listening to what\nI’ve been saying at all?!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_3300_10": "You, young [EN:Gen Ref=\"255\" M=\"sir\" F=\"miss\" ], are ill qualified to be\na Trainer! What do you expect to achieve\nat the PML if you can’t even comprehend that?",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_3400_10": "Oh dear, I do apologize...\nI get so caught up in my own enthusiasm.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_3500_10": "Just as I do with the recipes I create,\nI have endeavored to draw out my\nClawitzer’s maximum potential...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_3600_10": "and with me doing so, Clawitzer has also helped\nme draw out my own potential as a Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_3700_10": "And just as certain ingredients and spices\nserve to heighten the flavor of others\nin a recipe...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_3800_10": "so, too, do Pokémon and their Trainers.\nWe are better together. I’ve witnessed it\nin others and experienced it firsthand.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0301_3900_10": "Incredible, huh!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0401_4000_10": "Yes, indeed! But what it all boils down to\nin the end is...I want nothing more than to\ntruly connect with my Pokémon. That’s it.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0302_4100_10": "That’s intense!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_0402_4200_10": "Yes, indeed! But what it all boils down to\nin the end is...I want nothing more than to\ntruly connect with my Pokémon. That’s it.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_4300_10": "Well now! All of this talking has\nmade me work up quite an appetite.",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_4400_10": "We’ve already purchased all of the necessary\ningredients. I think it’s time we turned them\ninto something shockingly delicious!",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_4500_10": "Feast your eyes as Chef Siebold draws out\nthe limitless potential of the ingredients\nhe’s chosen for this dish...",
    "charaepi_ch0096_00_zumi/2301_1201_4600_10": "Let the battle begin!"
