    "ch0026_00_akane/0601_0701_02_10": "I’ve never seen scenery like this back home.\nThe girls and the Pokémon are all so cute, too!",
    "ch0026_00_akane/0601_0701_03_10": "Well, none of ’em are quite as cute as\nyours truly, though!",

    "ch0026_00_akane/0602_0701_03_10": "It’s very serious business, after all!\nAin’t it disappointing when you lose?",
    "ch0026_00_akane/0602_0701_04_10": "I know I get all kinds of disappointed! I feel sad\nfor my cute Pokémon when they lose, and that’s\nwhy I always cry when we’re bested.",

    "ch0026_00_akane/0605_0702_02_10": "You gotta show ’em how important they are\nto you with your words and your actions.\nThis is gettin’ kinda awkward.",
    "ch0026_00_akane/1701_0701_01_10": "I traded some of my Moomoo Milk for this.",
    "ch0026_00_akane/1701_0701_02_10": "You can have it if you want!",

    "ch0026_00_akane/2501_0702_02_10": "If you come to my hometown, I’ll introduce\nyou to all of them!",
    "ch0026_00_akane/2511_0701_01_10": "Do you like being alone or around others?",
    "ch0026_00_akane/2511_0701_02_10": "I can’t even think about passin’ time all\nquiet by myself.",
    "ch0026_00_akane/2511_0701_03_10": "There are so many things that are so much\nmore fun when you’ve got someone else around.",
