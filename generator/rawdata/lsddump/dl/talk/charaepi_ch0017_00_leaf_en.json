    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_0400_10": "Oh, look at that red flower! The color of passion!\nIt totally pops and stands out!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_0500_10": "Ooh! Or this black one! It’ll make you look a lot\nmore mature!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_0600_10": "Wow, you found so many, Eevee!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_0700_10": "Ooh, I like this blue one, too! It’s such a nice\ncool color!",

    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_0900_10": "Let’s see. You also found a purple flower, a pink\none, light blue... If we add the leaves, we can\nmake a wreath with eight colors total!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_1000_10": "Look at all these flowers you found, Eevee!\nIt’s like we have a small flower garden!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_0301_1100_10": "You’re going to use all of them?",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_0401_1200_10": "Of course! With so many, there’s no need to pick\njust one!",

    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_0301_1800_10": "Have Eevee decide himself!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_0401_1900_10": "Yeah. I think that’s the best option, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_0302_2000_10": "You should choose.",

    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_2200_10": "Eevee’s future is his own.\nHe should be the one to choose.",

    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_2800_10": "But enough of that! Eevee gathered a bunch of\ngreat flowers, so I’ll get to making that crown!",
    "charaepi_ch0017_00_leaf/2301_1201_2900_10": "Right now, I can choose to use all the colors I\nwant, but that won’t always be the case!\nGotta enjoy it while I can!"
