    "ch0108_00_nobori/7105_0701_03_10": "But that’s just a misunderstanding! I know I smile\nwhen I’m having fun!",
    "ch0108_00_nobori/7105_0701_04_10": "I’d even say that I’m quite proud of how\nexpressive I am when I speak!",
    "ch0108_00_nobori/7105_0701_05_10": "What? You say you’ve never seen me smile?\nI-is that so...",

    "ch0108_00_nobori/2511_0702_02_10": "There are as many rules out there as there are\nways to win a battle... That’s what makes\nPokémon battles so interesting!",
    "ch0108_00_nobori/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! I know it’s early, but don’t forget\nyour safety checks. Always look both ways before\ncrossing the street. Come, let’s go!",
    "ch0108_00_nobori/3003_0701_01_10": "Don’t be lulled to sleep by the afternoon\nsunshine! It’s time to start up your engines\nand get back on track!",
