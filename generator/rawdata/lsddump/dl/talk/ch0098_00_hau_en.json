    "ch0098_00_hau/0602_0701_02_10": "They are always asleep, and the only movements\nthey make or battles they get into are just them\nbeing restless sleepers.",
    "ch0098_00_hau/0602_0701_03_10": "They might not be able to see me, but \nmaybe we can be friends in their dreams!",

    "ch0098_00_hau/0605_0701_04_10": "I think what sets the good people and the bad\npeople apart is whether they can see the good\nin others or not.",
