    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0300_10": "These grunts aren’t much of a challenge.\nCome on, Wallace. Let’s take care of these\nlast few stragglers.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0400_10": "Man, are you seeing what I’m seeing?! Steven and\nWallace as a combo are just way too good!",

    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0700_10": "I’m sorry if I startled you... I couldn’t help but\nbe impressed.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_0800_10": "Look at Steven... He doesn’t waste a single\nmovement with his commands, and Metagross\nmatches him at every beat.",

    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1400_10": "I didn’t expect to see such an expert display...",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1500_10": "Well, one must come to expect this level of\nmastery when Steven is around.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1600_10": "He was particularly merciless back there, too...\nPerhaps it’s because his opponents were trying\nto steal stones.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1700_10": "Steven can be quite sensitive when it comes to\nstones. Cross him, and he turns into an entirely\ndifferent person!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1800_10": "It seems you all lucked out today! Not everyone\ngets the chance to witness the sheer power of\nSteven and his Metagross.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_1900_10": "Speaking of which, I trust your stone came out of\nthis fiasco safe and sound, Barry?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2000_10": "Snap, I almost forgot! I’ve got it right here.\nI wonder why those thugs were trying to steal it\nin the first place. It looks pretty ordinary to me.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2100_10": "Can I borrow it for a moment, Barry?\nI think you may be surprised...",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2200_10": "What? Whoa! Are you serious?!\nLook how pretty it is!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2300_10": "This stone may look ordinary on the outside,\nbut it’s actually quite rare. It’s called a geode.\nThose are crystals on the inside.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2400_10": "It takes years and years for the crystals to form\ninto something beautiful like this.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2500_10": "They must have brought in rock and soil from\nother regions when they were building up\nthese mountains.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2600_10": "Pasio’s origins as an artificial island come with\nall sorts of surprises, it seems. I never thought\nI’d find a geode like this here.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2700_10": "It’s really incredible, if you think about it.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2800_10": "Whoaaa! That’s so cool! I’ve never even seen\na stone like this before!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_2900_10": "Well, the largest ones can fetch a good price in\nthe shop, but I doubt those ruffians understand\nthe true beauty and value of these stones.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0301_3000_10": "Do you have any stones like this\nalready, Steven?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0401_3100_10": "I do, in fact. I have quite a variety of rare\ngeodes in my personal collection.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0302_3200_10": "Do you want this stone, too?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_0402_3300_10": "Oh, no. That one is for you to keep! I actually\nhave quite a variety of rare geodes in my\npersonal collection.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3400_10": "If you’re curious, you can always stop by and see\nthe collection yourself.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3500_10": "Pardon me, but... Um, Steven? Would it be all\nright if I challenge you to a Pokémon battle?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3600_10": "I’ve been hoping for an opportunity like this\nsince I first heard the rumors about you.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3700_10": "It’s something I’ve looked forward to for a\nlong time. What do you say?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3800_10": "Of course! Challenge accepted.\nHow are you feeling, Wallace?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_3900_10": "To be honest, a break would be nice. Barry,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ], this one is all yours.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4000_10": "All right! Let’s do this!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4100_10": "You’ve actually got me curious about\nsomething, Grant.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4200_10": "Really? What is it?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4003_1001_4300_10": "Let’s save that for after the battle, shall we?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0100_10": "Whew... Defeating the Champion is a wall that I\nam unable to surmount.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0200_10": "Aw, man! That was the rockiest battle I’ve been\nthrough in a long time!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0301_0300_10": "You were really strong!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0401_0400_10": "That’s my line! Your teamwork was amazing.\nTruly a sight to behold!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0302_0500_10": "Bet we could beat you again!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_0402_0600_10": "Well, I won’t let you win so easily next time.\nI’m going to continue to reach for the top—it will\nbe me who triumphs when we meet again.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0700_10": "That reminds me... You mentioned you were\ncurious about something earlier, Steven?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0800_10": "Yes. I wanted to ask you about the stones you\nuse in your hair.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_0900_10": "You know, I’ve actually been curious about the\nvery same thing! Are those stones part of your\nfashion, or...?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1000_10": "They are! I’ve always thought they fit well with\nmy style. There’s no special meaning behind them\nor anything, though.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1100_10": "Curious... But even if that’s the case, your\nplacement of the stones and choice of color\nare brilliant!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1200_10": "You may not put much thought into it, but you’ve\nclearly breathed life into those stones.",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1300_10": "Oh, I agree completely! It’s a wondrous hairstyle.\nNothing short of beautiful!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1400_10": "With your fashion sense, you and your Pokémon\ncould easily take first place in a beauty contest!",

    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1600_10": "Grant was super strong, too, right? I mean,\nhe’s a Gym Leader!",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1700_10": "I’m right, aren’t I? The secret to your strength\nhas to do with your stones, right?",
    "episode_event_ch0090_00_daigo/4004_1001_1800_10": "I do have a thing for stones. You’re right about\nthat much. But it goes deeper than that.",
